17336,"Use To-Do Lists the Right Way and Increase Productivity with awork","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why are to-do lists so important? We all organize our everyday life, write things on little notes and stick them on the refrigerator or the front door or make shopping lists so that we don't forget anything and then forget these notes when we get home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This process of writing things down helps keep our minds from bursting. When we write down the things we still need to think about, we imaginarily cross them out of our minds at the same time and therefore have more capacity for other processes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is also how we organize ourselves at work. We keep&nbsp;<a href=""https://blog.awork.io/wie-geht-das/aufgaben-planen-in-awork-so-nutzt-du-aufgabenlisten-fur-dein-projekt/"">to-do list of tasks</a>, that we still need to complete. Ideally, this process no longer happens in an analog way but digitally in a <a href=""https://www.awork.io/en/"">project management tool</a>. But to be truly productive, it's not enough to write everything on just any list.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simply writing everything down at random doesn't lead to us going home satisfied at the end of the day and feeling like we've really accomplished something. And let's be honest, wouldn't we all like to have that one feeling, preferably day after day?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So in this post, we're going to introduce you to some helpful tips on how to make the most of your to-do lists so that you can become truly productive. Of course, we'll also show you how to implement these methods easily in awork.</p>

<h2>To-Do-List App: Be more productive with priorities</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An important first step is to any project is to know your priorities. A helpful guide you can use is the well-known Eisenhower matrix. The first step is to write down all tasks, no matter how important or urgent they are. In awork you could do this by creating a list with the name To-Dos.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you can see, there are four quadrants in a coordinate cross that you can use as a guide. One axis refers to the importance, and the other axis to the urgency of your to-dos. The two axes result in the following combinations:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>There are tasks that are important and urgent. You should process these to-dos quickly, and they have a high impact.</li><li>Then there are tasks that are important but not urgent. You should keep an eye on these to-dos, but you don't have to do them on short notice.</li><li>On the other hand, there are tasks that are urgent but not important. For these tasks, you should act quickly but not spend too much time on them because they don't have such a high impact.</li><li>And last but actually least, there are tasks that are neither important nor urgent. You can actually say goodbye to such tasks right away.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Using the Eisenhower matrix, you can go through all your collected to-dos, divide them into the four quadrants and prioritize them that way. By dividing them into four areas, you get a much better overview of how many tasks are essential and how much attention they need from you. This helps show you which tasks you should start with and which tasks can wait. By doing this, you can take care of these particularly relevant tasks first and can allow you to delegate other tasks to your team if possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, you can also choose priorities independently of the Eisenhower matrix. Maybe other factors are more relevant for you, e.g., costs or long-term output. The important thing is that there is a specific prioritization that allows you to divide your tasks.</p>

<p>Fortunately, with the tools in awork it is quite easy to implement this theoretical construct into real-life action. The best thing to do is to create&nbsp;<a href=""https://app.awork.io/signup"">a new project</a>&nbsp;for the Eisenhower Matrix. In this project, you now create five lists:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>To-Dos: This list is a collection of all your tasks. Every new task ends up on the To-Do list.</li><li>Priority 1: This list is for all important &amp; urgent tasks. You should take care of these to-dos first and with the utmost care.</li><li>Important: This list contains tasks that are important but not urgent. Take care of these to-dos in peace.</li><li>Urgent: This list is for all tasks that are less important but should be done quickly. With these, you should take action quickly but make sure not to waste too much effort.</li><li>Backlog: This is where tasks end up that you might do if there is capacity. All tasks that are neither important nor urgent go into this task list.</li></ul>

<p>If you stick to the outlined productivity concept, your Priority 1 list should actually always be empty because you don't let tasks become important and urgent at the same time. However, sometimes you rely on other people to complete your to-dos. Therefore, it is important that you have this list option available. However, try to complete all the tasks in this list as quickly as possible and carefully. So, every morning, you should first dedicate yourself to the Priority 1 list.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second list (Important) is probably where most of your to-dos will end up. Here you should also find a visual way to prioritize the tasks in the list. Use the Prio button in awork to highlight some tasks. Alternatively, you can simply sort the to-dos in this list by importance.</p>

<p>Many tasks only look important at first glance. But when you take a closer look, you realize that they are not. A good example of a task in the urgent list would be answering a certain email that should be answered promptly, but there are tasks that are much more important at the moment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We've mentioned it before, and the fourth list should ultimately get little attention from you. Tasks that fit into this grid keep you from becoming truly productive. However, they may become important or urgent at a later time. Therefore, it helps to just write them down and put them on this list. Once written down and filed in awork, this to-do can disappear from your mind, and you will have more time and energy for the other tasks.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eisenhower Matrix is designed to help you set priorities and stick to them as you work through them. Therefore, you should consistently list all daily tasks in your to-do list and distribute them to the other lists once a day (alternatively once a week). If new tasks are added during the day, always add them to the to-do list. It is important that you constantly check your lists. Maybe a priority has shifted, and a task now belongs in another list? Then assign it to the right list immediately. Your lists should always be up to date! Once you have internalized this routine, it will happen automatically and cost you less energy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the way, a little tip from self-management coach Thomas Mangold is to end each to-do in your lists with a verb. This verb should directly convey to you what needs to be done in this task, e.g., write, call, contact, email, produce, etc. We really like this tip because it is immediately apparent what needs to be done, which in turn helps to get things actually done.</p>

17344,"3 Reasons Why Automatic Project Management Can Change Your Life","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You are probably more familiar with automation in your everyday life. For example, there are coffee machines that automatically brew your coffee at 7 a.m. Or bank transfers that are entirely made on their own, so you don't forget to pay your bills. These <strong>automatic processes</strong> in automatic project management are now so naturally integrated into everyday life that you no longer even notice that they exist.</p>

<p>All automation that runs in your everyday life has one thing in common: it makes your life easier. Every automation is one less thing you have to take care of yourself.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even in your professional life, some things are constantly repeated and could easily be taken over by a machine. Especially in project management, there are many recurring monotonous tasks that can keep you from doing your actual work!</p>

<p>Automatic project management starts at the point where your time and energy could be better spent. It is mainly about <strong>automating administrative tasks</strong> that are often repetitive and, quite frankly, not fun.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Imagine, for example, that you are a project manager responsible for several customer projects. To make your work worthwhile, you plan approximate time efforts on the different tasks. Of course, you don't want these scheduled hours to be constantly exceeded. In principle, you would have to continually check how many hours have already been worked on a single to-do. How annoying is that? We say, very. In this time, you could have taken care of so many other things.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This example is a perfect use case for automation. A smart project management tool like awork can <strong>automatically inform you every time the planned effort on a task is exceeded</strong>. This allows you to get a notification or even an email directly in the tool when too many hours have been recorded on a task. This project management software can also automatically change the status of the task. If a task enters the status allotted time exceeded, you can immediately see that something is not going according to plan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""40px""} -->
<div style=""height:40px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Example</strong>: As soon as the status of a task changes to feedback, you want the task to be assigned to your colleague Julia. Additionally, you want Julia to receive a Slack message. This is just a glimpse into what automation would look like in awork:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So as long as the tool doesn't warn you, everything is smooth sailing. This makes manually checking project statuses a thing of the past. In short: <strong>this allows more time for the part of your work you enjoy the most.</strong> Automatic project management is awesome!</p>

<p>Automatic project management not only gives you more time for work that is important to you but by being automatically notified when things don't go as planned, you'll also have <strong>much more planning security</strong>. After all, you no longer have to rely solely on yourself but have the helping hand of a smart software at your side that reacts reliably and proactively.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <a href=""https://www.awork.io/en/blog/project-management-on-autopilot/"">autopilot in awork</a> works exactly according to this principle. Yes, an autopilot, like in an airplane. When you activate the autopilot in awork, you can put your feet up and relax and let awork take care of the rest. <strong>When things get critical, the autopilot sounds an alarm, giving you plenty of time to react</strong>.</p>

<p>How exactly does it work? Basically, you hand over the classic project management tasks to your project management software: tracking project progress, deadlines, and budgets. The software takes over the responsibility for this part of your work and warns you immediately and automatically about tight deadlines, exhausted budgets, and outdated schedules. You can't get more planning security than that.</p>

<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That all sounds pretty good. But automated project management has another big advantage because by automating processes, you can make your workflow much more efficient overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A prime example of this is the feedback &amp; approval process that happens in almost every company. Often, unnecessary delays and bottlenecks occur here because the feedback loop was not properly considered during planning</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""60px""} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is precisely where automatic project management steps in again. This time, imagine you work in marketing and have to approve everything that is published. With smart project management software like awork, you can <a href=""https://support.awork.io/en/articles/5354365-automations-in-projects"">completely automate this review process</a>. For example, you can specify that each task is assigned to you as soon as the status changes to feedback, and you also receive a message that you need to approve the task.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>In awork, this function is so simple that anyone can easily create automatic workflows and simplify even very complicated processes in no time at all.</strong></p>

<p>In project management, too much time is wasted on administrative tasks and recurring tasks. In the end, that doesn't leave much time for the part of your work that creates real value and, most importantly, the part you love the most. So why not use a project management tool like awork that takes the monotonous part of the work off your hands? Automatic project management frees up <strong>time for meaningful work</strong> and ensures <strong>greater planning reliability and more efficiency in your team processes</strong>.</p>

<p>With the visual schedule in awork you can display all tasks of a project in a timeline. This allows each team member to easily see when individual tasks need to be completed and how much time has been scheduled for each to-do.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to the list and board view, we have integrated a third option into awork for exactly this purpose: The Timeline.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your existing tasks are automatically displayed in the timeline if you have set a start and end date for each task.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All other tasks are displayed in the Unscheduled Tasks column to the right of the Timeline. From there, you can easily drag and drop the to-dos into the overview. You can also create new tasks directly in the Timeline. All you need is a simple click on the timeline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tip: You can assign responsibilities directly from the timeline. The status color of the task provides an additional overview. This changes automatically when you adjust the task status.</p>

<p>As you might expect from visual planning, you can also now see dependencies in the awork Timeline. If there's a task waiting upon the completion of another task, you can display this dependency in awork with an arrow. This feature allows you to detect dependency problems before they occur.

<p>Unlike many other planning tools, you can display multiple tasks in one line in awork. This gives you an even better overview and prevents your planning from becoming unnecessarily long.</p>

17354,"5 Home Office Learnings for Team Collaboration","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the past year, we've learned to rethink work. Corona has made a big difference not only in our daily lives but also in how we work together in teams. While some of our team members already regularly worked from home before Corona and brought experience in digital team organization and the necessary technical infrastructure, it was still an unfamiliar situation to organize the whole team in a hybrid way. Now some time has passed, and the initial new workflows are slowly becoming routine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last year, we asked awork users ""what was the biggest hurdle for them in this transition?"". One of the most common answers: <strong>team collaboration comes up short</strong>. When we look back now, what learnings can we draw from that time? How can we implement digital collaboration in teams in the long term?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our team identified the following five key points:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>Starting the week together</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since the switch to the home office, our marketing team has introduced an additional weekly kick-off and now starts the week together every Monday. In the office, the team meeting usually only happens at the end of the week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you work in the same place, you also exchange ideas more often during the week. That way, you get to see what everyone is working on. Spontaneous meetings for a short team update are also not uncommon. But if everyone sits at home, it's much easier to lose sight of what the others are doing during the week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thanks to the weekly kick-off, everyone knows directly which to-dos are pending in the team. There is also direct coordination on who does what and on which topics they work together. And of course, starting the week together is also great for the team mojo!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>Introduce daily update meetings</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To ensure that the other teams do not miss out on the mutual exchange of ideas, our colleagues have also experimented with short daily meetings. At the same time, our development team works according to the <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/lesenswert/projektmanagement-methoden/"">Scrum Method</a>, so they also continue to meet remotely for Daily Scrum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since the changeover to the home office, the support team has also introduced a daily team meeting. Even if they don't work in the same place, complex topics can be discussed collectively. For the sales team, the morning check-in and evening check-out are also now part of their daily home office routine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":60} -->

<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just 10 to 15 minutes is enough to distribute tasks, exchange information on each other's progress, and clarify ambiguities. This is not only great for the team structure, but it also saves time. Central coordination prevents to-dos from falling by the wayside or topics from being discussed twice.</p>

<h3>Using chats correctly</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Communication is key - this is especially true for collaboration in the home office. A video call is not always necessary. We use the chat tool Slack for internal team communication. Since the changeover to the home office, certain functions have become particularly important in order to collaborate smoothly, even while remote.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Using the <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/neues-feature/jetzt-neu-direkte-slack-integration-fuer-produktive-teams/"">Slack integration</a>, we can connect a channel directly to the respective awork project. All events in awork are thus displayed directly in the Slack channel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":60} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We use topic-based channels for quick agreements between the teams. For example, if support asks a question in their channel, our developers are notified and can respond quickly and directly..</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even if several team members are working together on a topic, we simply set up a separate channel just for them. In this way, questions are clarified centrally, regardless that everyone is sitting at home. In addition, communication is clearly documented for everyone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":60} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to the increased use of chats in the home office, this can lead you to being involved in many discussions. However, focus is also required for specific topics. To work without distractions, you should not only set your own status to Away but also temporarily pause your chat notifications.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Transparency is key to productive collaboration in the home office. This includes knowing who is currently available and who is not. Since the switch to home office, our team has started using the status feature in Slack even more extensively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, we have predefined certain statuses. So you can change your own status to ""In a meeting"" or ""Lunch"" with one click. You can easily see who is available at the moment and thus save yourself from impatiently waiting for an answer.</p>

<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":60} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For even more transparency in the home office, it is also helpful to record times directly on specific tasks. Our team uses awork for this, of course! This makes it easier to estimate how time-intensive individual tasks are.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, thanks to the <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/neues-feature/jetzt-neu-die-individuelle-zeitauswertung-fuer-dich-und-dein-team/"">individual time evaluations</a>, you have an overview of who has worked on which project and for how long.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have noticed that many of our teams have been organizing meetings differently since the changeover. In the home office, meetings are less likely to happen spontaneously, which allows for more precise planning and better preparation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The onboarding team, for example, now gathers the topics to be discussed collectively in advance. This means that everyone can think about the topics before the meeting, allowing them to be better prepared. All the relevant information is then exchanged and discussed during the meeting.</p>

<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unanswered questions cannot be discussed afterward over a quick chat at the coffee machine, as is the case when at the office. For this, a new video call would have to be scheduled in the home office. A clear agenda also helps limit the meeting to the essentials and uses the time as efficiently as possible.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Regular team updates: The switch to a home office has made it even more apparent how important it is to have regularly scheduled exchanges within the team. Mutual coordination is not only efficient but also great for team spirit. For even more productive collaboration, team updates also remain a fixed component in the office - whether as a weekly kick-off, evening check-out, or Daily Scrum.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Efficient communication: We will also make more use of chats after returning to the office. This way, we are less likely to be thrown off track by intervening questions. More people can participate in discussions, and agreements are documented for all to see. Another tip we've learned: When you need an environment without distractions, don't be afraid to turn off push notifications for a while. We will also continue to maintain focused communication through a clear agenda in meetings in the office.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Even more transparency: even after the Corona crisis, everyone should know if someone is in the office, working remotely, or on vacation. We will also continue to maintain our own Slack statuses in everyday office life. We will also continue to track time on tasks to make our own capacity transparent and to better distribute to-dos within the team.</li></ul>

<p>&nbsp;Project management and work management are two terms that are regularly heard and used, but often, many people don't understand the differences. These terms lead to confusion again and again and are sometimes used in the wrong context. In this article, they will be explained thoroughly to help you differentiate between the two.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":60} -->

<h2><strong>What is classical project management?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The difference between project management and work management lies in principle in the different applications in which the methods are used.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Project management (PM) is an organizational method for one-time projects. This means that these projects have deadlines. They are limited in time and are completed within this timeframe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In PM, certain <strong>methods are used to plan, control and execute a project</strong>. The project manager's task, together with his project team members, is to work together to achieve all project goals and milestones. The success of a project is defined by a <strong>clear goal</strong>. Therefore, teams working on such projects are also short-lived. However, care should always be taken to ensure that the skills of the employees complement each other. This is the only way to create a cohesive project team. Here's an example to help illustrate this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":60} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is a new assignment in your agency. You are assigned to set up a complete marketing campaign for a new major client and create a design for their new product..&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":53} -->
<div style=""height:53px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Project structure</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For every project, there is a responsible person, in this case, the project manager; let's call him Markus. He makes sure that everyone in the team knows what they are responsible for, supports each other and that all deadlines are met. Markus starts by creating tasks for this project, putting together a team, and distributing these tasks among the various colleagues. Larissa, Max, and Julia are tasked with creative brainstorming, formulating ideas, and creating the campaign. Björn takes care of the appropriate design.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>This organization is the only way to work productively on the project</strong>. Otherwise, the employees would possibly hinder each other, work would be done twice on one task, or a task might even be forgotten entirely. Of course, the example from the agency chosen for clarification describes the ideal situation. In reality, Max and Larissa also have to manage a second important project, which means that the entire planning process can be thrown into disarray from time to time. This is where <strong>the right software can help with project organization</strong>. After all, we all know that such helpers are essential, give us structure and save us from forgetting something important every now and then.</p>

<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

<p>Ideally, every employee working on a project is aware of who is responsible for which task at all times, thanks to the chosen method.&nbsp;</p>

<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A popular method is, for example, the Gantt chart. This is a particular form of the bar chart. It <strong>graphically represents all the scheduled activities of the project</strong>. This allows for the progress of a project to be visualized exceptionally well. In addition, it also serves as a suitable means of communication between the project stakeholders.</p>

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another method is the network planning technique. It is used to <strong>organize the planning and control of projects</strong>. This method shows the logical and temporal sequence of sub-processes, also through a graphical representation. Individual sections of a project are considered, and these are arranged chronologically. Thus the network offers, among other things, a detailed time analysis.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Work management methods would also help us in our current day-to-day business. Because here, too, there are a lot of work processes that can be standardized. Project management has exemplified how much better we can work with structure. For example, we could implement this knowledge in the <strong>daily work routine</strong> and thus structure ourselves more efficiently. For example, in internal marketing, it would also help to discuss internal projects, topics, and deadlines, define contact persons and assign tasks to each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In work management (WM), the well-thought-out methods from project management are transferred and applied to the current day-to-day business. The primary goal is not to complete a project but rather to optimize the internal productivity culture. This includes the general <a href=""https://www.awork.io/en/product/"">daily organization</a> of work, as well as <a href=""https://www.awork.io/en/product/"">reliability in the processing of tasks, consultation</a> between the individual departments involved, and compliance with internal and external <a href=""https://www.awork.io/en/product/"">deadlines</a>. In principle, the aim is to ensure that important information about internal tasks is presented clearly and transparently so that work can be carried out in a structured manner within the team. Of course, these can also be <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/neues-feature/wie-man-wiederkehrende-aufgaben-in-awork-erstellt/"">recurring tasks</a>. These would be, for example, the weekly or monthly newsletters that have to be created and sent out for a customer.</p>

<h3>Method in work management - The Kanban Board</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One popular method in WM is the <a href=""https://www.awork.io/en"">Kanban board</a>. The workflow is clearly visualized with their help. The tasks are divided into process phases. Mostly consisting of divisions into ""to be done,"" ""in progress,"" and ""done."". Each task must therefore pass through these phases. This makes it clear at a glance <strong>which and how many tasks are in a certain phase</strong>. This knowledge can then be used to assist in planning further.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the help of good work management like <a href=""http://awork.io/product"">awork</a>, the information transfer from individual business processes is improved so that organizational challenges can be better mastered. But how can this be applied in a company in concrete terms? To illustrate this, let's take another look at the agency:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>How can the team in the agency work together more productively through work management?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a good WM, the <strong>handover of compact tasks</strong> is an important component. Within these tasks are detailed information, deadlines, previous activities, and contacts. For example, Larissa from the marketing team communicates with Tom from the HR department via a work management tool. She informs him in the created task that this job has been completed, that she has feedback on this task, or that the job posting has been released. It is particularly efficient if all relevant information on the tasks can be clearly stored in the WM program. Thus, <strong>all relevant documents, any agreements, and deadlines can be found in the tasks themselves</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, if the job posting is concerned, then both Larissa's text and Tom's comments are stored in a new document in the appropriate task in the work management tool. This means that both Tom and Maria now have a clear visualization of the status of the task and which documents belong to the task. The work process is thus also comprehensible for Larissa's colleague when she is filling in for Larissa during her vacation. This is extremely practical because it <strong>prevents duplication of work</strong> and, in turn, wasting time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>Better overview and transparency with productive work management</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last but not least, <strong>bosses also need an overview of all projects and the workload of their employees</strong>. In our case, it would be immediately apparent that Larissa has quite a few tasks to complete and, therefore, currently has no free capacity for a new project - unlike her colleague. Thus, the new important order could be distributed directly to the employees who are still available for new tasks. The <strong>transparency of a WM</strong> should also be emphasized. Everyone, including the bosses, knows the task status. Here, the focus is not on controlling employees but is primarily used to <strong>agree on tasks</strong>. Maybe some help or a second opinion is needed for one task, which could be seen directly and scheduled accordingly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Work management with <a href=""http://awork.io/en"">awork</a> helps to avoid unnecessary or even duplicate work. This makes one's own daily work more reliable and comprehensible, also for colleagues and superiors. This is especially important for <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/awork-allgemein/wie-arbeitet-ihr-eigentlich-mit-awork/"">teams</a>, as agreements are clearly and transparently displayed, and tasks can be worked on in parallel.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.awork.io/en"">awork</a> helps you to organize yourself and your team better to help improve your <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/awork-allgemein/wie-arbeitet-ihr-eigentlich-mit-awork/"">workflow</a>. It is a work management tool where you can create all your tasks for certain topics in a structured way. This is done in projects. Now, this may seem confusing at first glance, but the idea and implementation of project management has finally proven itself and, as you've seen, now makes sense in daily business. Therefore, awork works with the practical division of projects to better structure yourself and your team, allowing you to become more productive together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In awork, you can create <a href=""https://www.awork.io/en"">projects</a>, invite <a href=""https://www.awork.io/en"">team members</a>, start creating tasks in those projects, and assigning the appropriate people to them. This way, everyone can see who is responsible for which task. It is particularly beneficial in that <strong>documents or files can be uploaded directly in the tasks, colleagues can be notified</strong>, and <a href=""https://www.awork.io/en"">communication</a> thus takes place in the task. This makes sure all your decisions on projects and tasks are always clearly documented.</p>

<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To ensure that you don't miss anything, you will also be notified by email if you have been named in a task. But awork also lets you and your team know when there is important news. With these smart notifications, everyone knows about urgent tasks. If you are waiting for feedback from a colleague, you can easily assign the task to them, so they know immediately that they are now in charge of completing that task.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you like, you can also easily <a href=""https://www.awork.io/en"">record your times</a> in awork. It will help you to get a better feeling of how long you need for some tasks. This way, you can plan better and be more productive. With awork, you can record your times by stopwatch, drag &amp; drop, or directly from your calendar. Or you can start tracking your time with Google Assistant!</p>

<p>Projects are limited in time and require a certain structure and organization to be carried out successfully. Specific project management standards have become established to help implement this. Work management builds on the idea of project management but organizes the internal communication in a company. This consists of managing the general day-to-day organization of work, reliability in processing tasks, consultation between the individual departments involved, and compliance with internal and external deadlines. In principle, the aim is to ensure that critical information needed to improve the workflow is presented in a clear and transparent manner so that work can be carried out in an efficient way within the team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before awork, we were struggling with other tools. The problem was that we never had everything in one place, and therefore, the organization itself was disorganized.</p>

<p>With awork, we have a smart project management tool that is outstanding in its design and functionality.</p>

<p>We create <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/webinare/awork-webinar-4-aufgabenpakete-nutzen-und-anlegen/"">different lists</a> for different departments, such as graphic design, social media marketing, or web development, each with assigned tasks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This gives us a structured overview of which departments need more resources and whether tasks have already been completed. Through this overview, the performance of the team can be viewed.</p>

<p>Every day starts with a warm cup of tea. The first thing the project manager has to do in the program is to enter the current, existing tasks into the awork lists. Afterward, the tasks are briefly discussed and coordinated in the morning stand-up meeting. This is when the real work begins because now the team starts to work through the tasks over the course of the day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Occasionally, during the course of the day, additional items are added, which are then scheduled by priority either immediately or for the next day.</p>

<p>With the help of the <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/neues-feature/visuelle-planung/"">timeline</a>, tasks and projects are discussed and planned in meetings to create a direct, visual overview.

<p>Although the term project plan is widely used, it is not clearly defined. The project plan is created and continuously updated by the project manager or at the beginning of the process. This maintenance is one of the most crucial project management tasks and takes a significant part of the working time, especially in larger projects. Depending on how extensive the project is, this plan can be more or less detailed. The crucial thing is a clear and understandable structure, especially for complex projects.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The work breakdown structure (WBS) contains the complete representation of all components of a project. For this purpose, the project is broken down hierarchically into subprojects and tasks. The work breakdown structure also shows the relationships between different project elements, but not the time sequence. The term work breakdown structure (WBS) already contains the principle of dividing components of the project. In terms of its graphic structure, the work breakdown structure is usually reminiscent of an organization chart, which shows the hierarchy of tasks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you supplement this plan with a time axis, we speak of a project execution plan. This also contains defined dates for the start and end of the project. The project schedule can also be supplemented with milestones that represent particularly important events or deadlines in the course of the project.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The project schedule is graphically similar to a calendar or a timeline. It gives you an overview of all deadlines in the entire project.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's start by looking at the initial situation of your project. Have you planned and executed similar projects in the past? Finding out which basics and prerequisites you will need to work on your project should always be the first step in creating your further planning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Check whether you can adopt certain elements, processes, or templates. What information is already available and what is still missing to start implementing the project?</p>

<h3><em><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Why</span> should this project be carried out?</strong></em></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This question is very important and yet often neglected. What (economic) benefits do you expect from this project? When is the investment worthwhile (return on investment)? What opportunities does this project offer? In a typical project clarification, one also speaks of the expected success outlook towards which one is working.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By answering these questions, you can prevent pointless projects from being initiated. On the other hand, if the benefit is clear, this consideration will help you to inspire others for your project, even in difficult phases.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To avoid misunderstandings and conflicts, everyone involved must know what the project goal is. The clearer and more measurable, the better! Try to formulate your goals according to the S.M.A.R.T principle. Unlike the success outlook, the project goal should describe very specifically what will be created, produced, or delivered directly as part of the work - not what it is intended to achieve in the long term.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In turn, it should also be clear what goals are not being pursued by the project. If this question has been considered and answered in-depth, it is much easier to follow up during project management if difficulties arise.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At this point in the creation of the project plan, you work out who is associated with this project. Who are the people involved in the project, and what roles should each team member play? It's not just about the direct project team, but also other parties involved, called stakeholders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here you should also check whether there are other interested or affected parties and how they can be taken into account. You should also define rules for cooperation within the team. For example, is there regular coordination in the form of a weekly or monthly catch-up?</p>

<p>Of course, you should not neglect the last question for the creation of your project plan. This is about resources and how much they may cost. Calculate how much effort will be required for the individual work packages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How should the budget be divided, and what are the total costs? The project costs are often already specified by the client, resulting in the (internal) cost planning.</p>

<h3><em><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">By when</span> should the project goal be achieved?</strong></em></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Often, a client will give you a deadline for the project, but you should set the deadline yourself for internal projects. In addition, you can divide the project into different time stages and milestones at this point. For example, determine when important sub-goals should be achieved.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That's all for the content and basis of a project plan; now it's time for the structure! The main characteristic of the structure is that all elements are structured hierarchically. A project consists of subprojects, which in turn consist of work packages, which are composed of subtasks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you have created a suitable plan, you can use it as a project plan template. Such templates facilitate the start of all further projects enormously, and many tools offer corresponding functions.</p>

<h2><strong><strong>Create project plan - example</strong></strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here's an example to help clarify: Imagine you want to plan a larger event to celebrate an important milestone with your colleagues. The sub-projects ""Organize team event"" include the sub-projects ""Location,"" ""Catering,"" and ""Plan schedule.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sub-project Location includes, for example, the work packages Research, Booking, and Preparation / Decoration. And the research work package includes, for example, the tasks of obtaining quotes and checking availability.</p>

<h3><strong><strong>Project schedule with Gantt chart</strong></strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""20px""} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's stay with the project plan example, Organize Team Event. While you've only shown the structure of the existing elements of the project plan so far, what's missing now is a time-based classification. Otherwise, there is a high risk of the event falling through due to a lack of lead time. So you always need to make sure you have a project schedule (see above).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A particularly widespread way of presenting a schedule is as a so-called Gantt chart. This was developed at the beginning of the last century by Henry Gantt.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a Gantt chart, the duration of the individual work packages is represented as bars. The arrangement of these bars on a horizontal time axis defines the beginning and the end of a task.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Especially in comparison to a classic calendar representation, the Gantt chart has the advantage that it can represent hierarchies and dependencies, making it much better for tasks that run over a long period of time.</p>

<h2><strong><strong>Create a project plan in awork</strong></strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""20px""} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, create a work breakdown structure by entering all components of your project in awork. It is best to proceed hierarchically. Second, make a list for each subproject in your awork project. Then add the corresponding tasks to this list, for which you can define subtasks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To create a project schedule, switch from the list view to <a href=""https://www.awork.io/en/blog/visual-planning/"">the timeline view</a>. This shows all the tasks of your project over time - like a Gantt chart, only better.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""60px""} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""60px""} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tasks for which you have already set a start and end date are automatically displayed in the timeline. Unscheduled tasks can be dragged and dropped from the list on the right side of the screen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Especially handy: To avoid your planning becoming unnecessarily long, you can display several tasks in one line in awork. This is one of the main differences between the timeline in awork and a generic Gantt chart, where there is only room for one task per line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""60px""} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now define dependencies between the tasks so that it is clear which things are to be worked on first. Finally, you can add important milestones by clicking on the respective date. Planning projects has never been easier!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As soon as you start working on your project tasks, they change color in the timeline, so you can always see the current status. In addition, it is always clear who is currently working on a topic - the user's face is displayed directly in the task.</p>

<p>At first glance, it may seem very complex to create a project plan. However, this plan will save you a lot of time and hassle in project management. So make sure to keep the plan up to date as you go along!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take your time to answer the 7 question words (Who? What? Where? When? Why? How? And how much?). Don't forget to write down all project elements in a structured and complete way, preferably in a project management tool, and last but not least, integrate a timeline and define the milestones.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The home remedy of the Excel spreadsheet should be avoided at all costs. Updating a ""hand-made"" project plan is no fun, error-prone, and unnecessarily time-consuming. Instead, let a <a href=""https://app.awork.io/signup"">clever software</a> like awork supports you, and nothing will stand in the way of your successful project!</p>

<h3><strong>What is a project plan?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A project plan bundles all plans and tasks that are important for the successful execution of a project. A work breakdown structure (WBS) is the complete representation of all project elements, and their relationships is called a work breakdown structure (WBS). A project execution<strong> </strong>additionally contains the time schedule.</p>

<h3><strong><strong>How is a project plan structured?</strong></strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A project plan contains all components of the project. Usually, a project consists of subprojects, which in turn consist of work packages composed of subtasks. The individual elements are structured hierarchically in the project plan to create a kind of tree structure.</p>

<h3><strong><strong>Why is a project plan useful?</strong></strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The project plan significantly reduces the complexity of your project. It presents all components of a project clearly and thus creates a clear and understandable structure. This saves a lot of time and trouble in project management.</p>

<h3><strong><strong>How do I create a project plan?</strong></strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Write down all project elements in a structured and complete manner. It is best to proceed hierarchically and orient yourself on the 7-W questions (Where? Why? What? Who? How? Until when? How much?). Once you have presented all project components, you can integrate a timeline and define milestones.</p>

<p>We started with something that has the greatest relevance to you. With the Unicorn release, we've completely revamped the task packages and project types section. These updates allow you to make the best use of templates and integrate them into your daily work. There are also now templates for projects and tasks instead of task packages and project types. In this new, simplified view, you can create new templates or edit and delete existing ones.</p>

<p>Jede*r Projektmanager*in kennt diese Tage, an denen man sich gleichzeitig um Projekte, Aufgaben, Teamplanung und Zeitauswertungen kümmern muss. An solchen Tagen ist es wichtig, die wesentlichen Dinge schnell zu finden und genau im Blick zu haben. Aus diesem Grund haben wir das Menü in awork vereinfacht.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Statt vielen Detailfunktionen findest du im Hauptmenü sechs feste Kategorien – nämlich die Kernbereiche in awork. Darunter gibt es weiterhin eine Liste mit deinen Projekten. Diese kannst du über das Stern-Symbol als Favorit im Menü fixieren bzw. wieder entfernen.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dem kompletten Bereich Einstellungen haben wir ebenfalls ein neues Layout und eine optimierte Struktur mit besser verständlichen Namen verpasst. Einige Menüpunkte haben wir dazu eine Ebene tiefer gepackt – damit bleibt mehr Platz für die wichtigen To-Dos und deine Projekte.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, more information about your tasks is now available at a quick glance - deadlines, task progress, and more can be seen in the new bubbles. When you hold your mouse over a task, you can edit it directly with the small Actions button.</p>

<p>Let's jump from the main menu to the second central menu - the app header. Here, too, we have done our best to make awork even more effortless, more precise, and more understandable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first change concerns your own awork profile. From now on, you can jump to your settings anywhere in awork via your profile picture and edit your user directly from there. Also, we've combined the subpages within your settings, so you don't have to jump back and forth as much.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":60} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another big enhancement is in notifications. We've split those into comments and notifications. So you have your normal notifications and your new and active conversations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the classic notifications, there's now no more status spam because we group the status changes. At the bottom left of the checkmarks in the notifications panel, you can also jump directly to the associated settings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":60} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, you can now respond to messages super fast by....</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>marking the message as read&nbsp;</li><li>or by snoozing the notification, so they don't reappear for an hour or until the next day.</li><li>The unfollow button lets you put an end to a conversation.</li><li>And with one click on a notification, you remove it from your feed.</li></ul>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Right next to the notifications, you will find the search field. Of course, we couldn't leave the search behind, so we improved that too! Whether you're on a customer call or need to get something done quickly, the redesigned search will help you find your to-dos and important information in no time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We now show the top ten matches in the search box. You can also find your menu items (for example, tasks or projects) super fast in the search by filtering by project, task, user, or customer in your search on the right side.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of super fast - the Quick Actions have also been enhanced. In the app header, you will now see a Quick Actions menu. You can use it to search for something in your workspace, create a new task or add a new time - either with keyboard shortcuts or by clicking on the selection.</p>

17400,"Now Active: Automate Your Workflow With awork","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What do you think about an entire task being automatically assigned to the right person once you've changed the status - pretty nice, right? That's exactly what is possible with our new feature, <a href=""https://support.awork.io/en/articles/5354365-automations-in-projects"">automation in awork</a>! 🤩</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With our new feature, you can trigger processes (in awork we call these processes actions). The actions will run completely automatically when certain conditions (called triggers) occur. You can have these automations be relatively simple, or you can create very extensive combinations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order for you to know how to use these automations most effectively, we will introduce you to the feature and take you through these automations in more detail in this post.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""60px""} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>What are automations?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, awork automations are if-then-then dependencies. You can also specify multiple actions for an automation and create them both for individual projects or for project types.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That sounds too complicated for you so far? No problem, we have a few examples to help you picture the power of awork automations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""><p>Good to know: You can define multiple actions for one trigger automation.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Automation in practice</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Imagine you work in marketing in a relatively small team and are responsible for content planning. Everything you publish should go through a feedback and correction process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even if there are only five of you on the team, you have quite a few tasks that need to be reviewed by you in a week. Usually, each task would now need to be assigned to you by clicking in awork when your colleagues change the status to feedback.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""60px""} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the new feature, you can completely automate this process. You can specify that as soon as a task in your project is changed to feedback status, it will be assigned to you automatically.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An example of another very practical automation would be that as soon as all subtasks have been checked off by your colleague Marcus, the task is set directly to done.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""60px""} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Automate complex processes</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes, however, such processes are a bit more complex. No problem, because with awork's automations, you can also execute multiple actions. Want an example?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Imagine you want to prevent planned time efforts from being exceeded uncontrollably. This case is perfect for automation. For example, every time the recorded time on a task exceeds one hour, a predefined comment could be posted below the task. Also, you could additionally make sure that the status is changed.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The new feature makes it easy to automate complex relationships in your processes. You can access over 700 combinations with the new feature. 😍</p>

<h2><strong>Setting up automation - it's that easy!</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, you have to choose a trigger, e.g., the event that has to occur for the automation to start. You can either search for a specific trigger or click through the icons and select a suitable one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, if you want the stopwatch to automatically stop tracking time when a task is set to done, select this trigger when the status is changed to Done.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some triggers are specifically related to a user, a time, or something similar. In this case, you have to specify these concrete conditions within the trigger. Elements that require a condition are underlined in awork. In our example, the status is selectable. By clicking on the highlight, the appropriate options will appear. You can also make an entry directly.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then you select the appropriate action to be triggered. Again, you can select the range or browse all actions. Also, for actions, it is sometimes necessary to define further conditions. In our example, you would select this: ...stop time recording on the task.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Asana is particularly suitable for teams that like to work with classic PM tools such as task lists or boards.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A simple tool with the most important functions for teams with simple requirements and no need for e.g. capacity planning or budget management.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pro:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The Kanban view of the tool with tasks in the calendar view and practical automation options simplify your&nbsp;<strong>daily task management.&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Contra:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Meistertask focuses on projects and tasks. It&nbsp;<strong>does not offer budget management, capacity planning, or project templates.&nbsp;</strong></li><li>Also, the communication within the tool is not optimal due to the missing chat function for collaboration.</li></ul>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>factro is a good choice for individuals or small teams, as basic functions are covered. Nevertheless, teams that don't want to use external chat tools should look for alternatives due to the missing team chat feature.</p>

<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Evernote is suitable for simple projects and orga topics, as it offers space for digital notes. It can be useful support for complex task management in a team, but it quickly becomes confusing when planning a wide variety of projects and offers little storage space.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pro:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Optimal for <strong>creating notes</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>Evernote is absolutely sufficient for a <strong>simple organization and planning of tasks</strong>.</li><li>The tool offers templates for your notes, and you can also scan and upload documents.&nbsp;</li><li>Cross-device synchronization is possible.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<h2><strong>Task management, task planning, to-do list - what is the difference?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Task management tools are versatile: whether you are working on a complex project or want to keep track of a single task, they support you in your daily work. The goal of task management is to find your tasks bundled in one place and to be able to access and edit them at any time.</li><li>The classic to-do lists are considered the holy grail of&nbsp;<strong>self-organization</strong>&nbsp;and contain personal lists with all the items that need to be processed. Even with these lists - on paper, a flipchart, or in an app - you find your tasks in one commonplace.&nbsp;</li><li>The&nbsp;<strong>difference between to-do lists and task management</strong>&nbsp;is that they are limited to the most important functions: To-do lists are super simple and usually have only basic features, whereas task management includes more diverse options (prioritizations, work steps, tags, etc.).&nbsp;</li><li>If you're aiming for&nbsp;<strong>long-term planning and management</strong>&nbsp;of your tasks, a to-do list is probably not enough - here you need a practical task management tool from the selection above. With this tool you unite all company-internal tasks in one central tool and can plan even complex work steps.&nbsp;</li><li>A suitable software - such as awork - helps you to&nbsp;<strong>coordinate your tasks&nbsp;</strong>and to make the&nbsp;<strong>meeting of important deadlines visible</strong>. In addition, with task management, you can delegate possible subtasks to your colleagues and work more productively with your team.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>The challenge of task management in your team is to ensure that all team members have <strong>access to the same data pool</strong> and that communication through the tool is seamless.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, if you are looking for an optimal solution for your team, pay attention to the following <strong>features for team task management</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>A chat feature within the tool - it helps your team communicate on tasks, projects, and tag users.</li><li>The ability to prioritize - so each team member knows which tasks need to be completed first.</li><li>Assigning tasks - a basic but extremely important feature is to be able to delegate tasks to your team members.</li><li>Real-time smart notifications - always be informed about the status of your to-dos.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A software like awork is specifically designed for collaboration in teams of any size and covers all the above requirements. Our features are designed for <strong>smart team collaboration</strong> - we want to help you become more productive together.</p>

<p>Do I need time tracking software in my company? Many skeptics argue against it because time tracking is often still seen as a means to control employees. This is understandable because far too often, the purpose of time tracking is not communicated transparently. The result: the team resists it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The real benefits of time tracking software, in addition to&nbsp;<strong>promoting self-monitoring</strong>, are the&nbsp;<strong>improvement of internal company planning</strong>, as you can expose time guzzlers and make overtime transparent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tobias Hagenau, Co-Founder of awork, also tracks his working hours. This gives him a&nbsp;<strong>detailed insight</strong>&nbsp;into which areas of the company he spends his time on. In addition to much better expectations for the&nbsp;<strong>actual effort required</strong>, he also knows the costs of the individual activities and can always reflect on his&nbsp;<strong>priorities</strong>. This makes time recording an irreplaceable tool in the&nbsp;<strong>continuous improvement of his productivity</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>If you introduce time tracking software,&nbsp;<strong>communicate the decision transparently</strong>&nbsp;to your team in advance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>The most important aspect of choosing software is simple: you need to know if your team can work with it in a meaningful way - a highly complex tool is of no use if no one in your team voluntarily tracks working hours.</li><li>When choosing software, we also recommend that depending on team size and requirements, you also pay attention to the variety of tracking and time evaluation options.</li><li>Start by working with the new time tracking tool yourself to evaluate it and ask your team for&nbsp;<strong>feedback</strong>&nbsp;after implementation. Everyone involved should be able to use it properly so that there is no additional work.&nbsp;</li><li>It can also be useful to offer a<strong>&nbsp;workshop</strong>&nbsp;to introduce a time tracking system. By&nbsp;<strong>clearly communicating the benefits of time tracking</strong>&nbsp;for employees and the company, you can promote acceptance among your team and create transparency.&nbsp;</li></ul>

18750,"Incoming! Fox Release 🦊: Multi-Assignment, Preview of your Project Templates & more","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, in September, you can look forward to some brand new updates! Now presenting the new awork release: codename Fox 🦊 with an awesome multi-assignment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With this release, we dedicate ourselves to one of the most requested features of the last months: From now on, you can <strong>assign multiple editors to one task</strong>. It is not only important to us to put a lot of expert knowledge and a large portion of joy of work into the new features but also to let the feedback of all users assist in the further development of awork.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this blog post, we will introduce you to all the new features. We hope you enjoy discovering the new updates!</p>

<h3><strong>Multi-assignment</strong> in awork</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's start with the biggest new feature of this release, the multi-assignment! From now on, you <strong>can assign multiple agents to one task.</strong> This is handy for all cases where different team members work together on the same task.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Want an example? In every awork release, different people work on the task of developing feature X: you create a concept for the feature, define the design of the feature, developers implement the concept, various feedback loops have been performed. Many of these steps take place in parallel. For each area, thanks to the new update, several people can be assigned to the same task. By being assigned as the responsible person, each person keeps track of the task by having it appear on their own to-do list.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another example: Your team is planning a marketing strategy. You create a new task called <strong>Determine target group</strong> and assign three of your colleagues to this task:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Lucas is responsible for the target group research.</li><li>Anna takes over the competition analysis.</li><li>Tobias designs the final personas.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This means that all three can start and work on the task in parallel. Alternatively, the three would have to assign the task to each other after each step - this makes sense if the steps are worked through one after the other. However, If team members are working on something in parallel, multi-assignment is the way to go.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The admin of a workspace can enable multi-assignment in the settings under <em>General</em> with one click. In some cases, <strong>limiting tasks assigned to one person can also have advantages</strong> - depending on the use case and workflow. For example, with a single assignment, only the staffed person ""wears the hat"" and is fully responsible for the task. If your team uses traditional project management methods or works in a workflow where people work on a task sequentially, this may be the better way to go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both options - limiting to one editor or multi-assignment - have their advantages and disadvantages, so the decision for one of the options should take into account your team structure and the daily way of working.</p>

<ul><li>awork app users take note: We have <strong>improved the mobile features in the awork app</strong>. So comments now look the same as in the web app and responses to comments are much more reliable.</li><li>When you export awork lists as <strong>Excel files, they now contain two new columns</strong>: the budget and the project owner.</li><li>With the new automation, your team will know directly that new tasks are coming up: When you create a new task, all <strong>observers of this task can be automatically notified by mail</strong>. You can define the content of the mail once in advance. This saves you a lot of time and effort when you create new to-dos.</li><li>Another new feature is the auto option for project templates: When you create a project, it automatically becomes billable - depending on whether you have selected specific customers or not.</li><li>Also new is the <strong>10-hour limit for time tracking.</strong> This feature is by default disabled but can be enabled in the settings if needed.</li><li>Last but not least, we have improved the loading time in the time evaluations and the permissions.</li></ul>

<p>Sound familiar? In today's working world, we quickly get the feeling of permanent work stress because we are working on so many topics at the same time and want to get them done ""just quickly"". At the end of the day, we have the impression that we haven't accomplished anything of what we actually set out to do - as a result, we feel stressed, unproductive, and not at all happy. Science is also concerned with this rush-hour life: According to a 2019 study by YouGov, 82 percent of all respondents felt stressed at work - that's&nbsp;<strong>four out of five workers</strong>. Even more so, In the last two ""pandemic years,"" the work stress phenomenon is likely to have intensified.</p>

<p>What can we do to bring more joy back into our working lives? How do we escape the work stress trap? We spoke to expert Johanna Heußner from <a href=""https://www.coachyourventure.de/"">CoachYourVenture</a> about this. We wanted to know why we sometimes find it so difficult to set clear boundaries at work and how constant work stress worsens our long-term performance.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Hey Johanna! It's become almost normal to spend the end of the day working. Some even work late into the night simply to escape the constant time and performance pressure. Overall, it seems as if work and private life are becoming increasingly blurred. What are the health and mental risks of this ""always-on mentality"" for us as employees?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the case of short-term stress, hormones are released that are actually helpful for the moment. They make us more efficient, reduce sensitivity to pain and strengthen the immune system. With longer-lasting stress, the dose turns into poison, and the effects are reversed by constant ""alertness"". Our performance is significantly reduced, short-term memory and concentration suffer. In addition, sleep quality is reduced, and we are significantly more susceptible to illness. Instead of increasing performance, the ""always-on mentality"" reduces our performance.</p>

<p><strong>According to the work-life balance model, work and private life should be in harmony with each other. What should the optimal balance between work and leisure look like?</strong><br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How much work stress you can tolerate and when the positive effects turn into the opposite varies from person to person. Sometimes private life is more stressful than a fulfilling job. After stressful phases - whether private or professional - it is generally important to recharge the batteries properly, with whatever gives you strength - sports, reading in peace, meditating, meeting friends. The prerequisite for this is, of course, that you 1) notice how you feel and what brings you happiness and 2) then also take the time for it.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>And how do I find out whether I have the right work-life balance?</strong><br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Optimally, you have good access to yourself and an intuitive sense of whether tension and relaxation are in a good balance. But not everyone succeeds in doing this. A bad balance is often only noticed later through stress symptoms: One is irritated, quickly annoyed, and tired. If the ""alertness"" has taken on a life of its own due to constant high stress, the feeling of inner restlessness persists, even though there is no rational reason for it.&nbsp;<strong>Since one quickly gets used to the symptoms, one can also keep a kind of work stress diary to assess the well-being more objectively. Or you can ask people who know you well about their impressions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>We often hear tips such as taking time off, asking the boss to work fewer hours, and delegating tasks to reduce work stress - but in the end, implementing them is not so easy. Why do so many people find it so difficult to set clear boundaries and consciously break away from performance thinking?</strong><br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whenever we want to achieve a goal (go towards), there is always the opposite that we want to avoid (stay away from). And it is precisely the ""away-from"" that makes life difficult for us. The negatively anticipated consequences drive us: for example, the fear of being perceived as lazy or conflict-averse or of making mistakes. Also, the threat of losing control, power, and influence pushes us ""away from"" and ""toward"" more work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Such fears are unfounded most of the time. But the often unconscious emotional cost-benefit calculation weights possible negative consequences more heavily than real health risks. This can affect all levels of the hierarchy. If you, yourself, would like to reduce your performance with a clear conscience, the alarm bells can still ring with your supervisor. Team members can quickly tell from body language or half-hearted slogans whether rest is actually okay or whether work-life balance is just a fine-sounding phrase in the company's principles.</p>

<p><strong>It is not only the employee who bears responsibility, but also the boss. What can employers and team leaders do to protect their team from burnout and work stress, especially in the home office? Do you have some hands-on tips for us?</strong><br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From my point of view, it is important to be fully mentally behind the measures and to be honest with yourself. Are there any negatively anticipated consequences, if any? What negative experiences have you had before, and what impact do those thoughts and experiences have on the goal of protecting the team from burnout in the home office?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am also a big fan of finding individual solutions together with the team, e.g., preventing misuse of freedoms. If you take time for the topic in a small workshop, you can come up with amazingly ingenious and versatile solutions that fit the team and the situation perfectly. There is also nothing to be said against openly sharing one's concerns with one's team in order to make one's behavior more understandable.</p>

<p>Supportively, <strong>it can help to set<a href=""https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_(Projektmanagement)""> </a></strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria"">s.m.a.r.t. goals</a> not only for performance but also for rest. For example, when, how often, and how long do you want to take a break during a workday? How much time do you want to invest in relaxing hobbies and what is important to you? With conscious goals, you can better prioritize and track whether you've allowed yourself time for rest. Also, the question ""What's the worst that can happen?"" reflects that the negative consequences are usually not as bad as the inner critic makes it seem.</p>

<p><strong>The Pain: Constant overload and lack of capacity produce work stress.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""Do you still have capacity?"" - the standard saying in your team. Planning is done with Excel lists, sticky notes, or chalkboards (😜). If a colleague is absent, the to-dos are randomly handed over to other team members - sometimes without their knowledge and at the whim of the team leads. Overlaps with other projects are constant - but no one really knows when exactly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The result:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Deadlines are missed.</li><li>The team is permanently stressed.</li><li>Lastly, important milestones are not reached because everything gets lost in the to-do chaos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""60px""} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The solution: Make capacities visible and avoid bottlenecks</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this case, it is not surprising that your team feels overloaded and that there are no open capacities due to a lack of organization. This is because the existing methods do not give you the proper overview between projects, nor can you react flexibly to bottlenecks and reschedule tasks. In addition, you reach your limits far too quickly with Excel, sticky notes &amp; Co. when coordinating distributed teams and are trapped in constant work stress.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the team planning in awork, you can switch between the project and team view. In the project view, you can show all projects that are relevant to you. This way, you can see at first glance if projects, milestones, or important deadlines overlap. If you see overlaps, you can expand the project and see all team members and their tasks. You can also make sure that to-dos are evenly distributed in parallel projects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the team view, the focus is on the personnel workload. In contrast to the project view, you can show team members and their capacities instead of projects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""60px""} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, a solution must be found if a team member is on vacation or absent due to illness. Because in this case, for time reasons alone, not every job can simply be handed over. After all, no one can manage the jobs of two people at the same time. With the classic handover email (or a handover meeting), the worst can be clarified. There you ask yourself which tasks have to be done and what can be left undone. The transfer of fixed deadlines and responsibilities provides security and enables transparent workflows.

<p><strong>The Pain: Bad time management and overtime like sand on the beach</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You have to postpone the deadline for the fifth time, can't save yourself from overtime, and don't know where your head is anymore because of all the to-dos? If you don't have good time management, you are often under a lot of stress. The lack of prioritization of tasks makes it difficult to concentrate on the important things. Maybe you spend too much time on administrative issues instead of focusing on implementing a strategy. But how do you know what you're spending your time on and how to be more productive?</p>

<p><strong>The solution: Intuitive time tracking for productive work without the constant work stress </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both in our jobs and in our private lives, we often tend to do things ""quickly"". But it happens all too often that the feedback of a newsletter takes 30 to 60 minutes or the call with a customer takes longer than expected. Nothing with ""just quickly"" is actually quick. That's why it's so important to get a realistic picture of your workload. The easiest way to do this is with time tracking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In awork, you can easily record times for a specific task or project: via the global timer, drag-and-drop in the weekly view, or directly in a task, also via the timer. Afterward, you can evaluate these times, export them or forward them directly to an invoicing tool of your choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:acf/caption {""id"":""block_6193dca9c4369"",""name"":""acf/caption"",""data"":{""block_style"":""image_right"",""_block_style"":""field_60f95b1275292"",""margin_top"":""mt-s"",""_margin_top"":""field_60f9580be9b20"",""margin_bottom"":""mb-s"",""_margin_bottom"":""field_60f9580be9b57"",""headline"":""Our tip: Track the time you need to complete your tasks.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Preferably start in the first week with being extremely consistent with time tracking on everything you do. Record all tasks, even the things you do quickly on the side, for this week. This will give you a detailed insight into the areas in which you use your time. In addition to a much better feeling for the actual effort required, you will also recognize the costs of the individual activities. In most cases, you will be surprised how much your own estimation differs from reality. Use your findings to set priorities more consistently in the future and to plan efforts more realistically.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have trouble prioritizing and intuitively determining which to-do is most important, you can work with the <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/wie-geht-das/to-do-listen-richtig-nutzen-und-noch-produktiver-in-awork-arbeiten/"">Eisenhower-Matrix</a>. This will effectively help you reduce your work stress through sensible task planning. You go through all your collected to-dos and divide them into four quadrants. You distinguish between to-dos that are important and urgent (priority 1), tasks that are only important or urgent (priority 2), and those that have neither importance nor urgency.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This will give you a much better overview of how many tasks need, how much attention from you, and which tasks can still wait. So that you can take care of these particularly relevant tasks first, you should delegate other tasks to your team. Some Prio 3 topics can probably be eliminated completely.</p>

<p>Do missing agreements, inaccurate briefings, and a lack of overview make your life difficult? That is pure work stress. It's not just team productivity that suffers from miscommunication, but also your team cohesion. How can this be improved?</p>

<p><strong>The solution: Successful collaboration thanks to clear communication</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Successful collaboration requires meaningful communication and a high level of transparency - regardless of whether your team works in the office or remotely. awork supports you in this! communicate with your team members directly in tasks, assign them to-dos and keep an eye on capacities. This way, you can not only communicate precise work instructions, but everyone in the team keeps a constant overview of the status of all tasks and all agreements. These measures reduce work stress enormously.</p>

<p>In some use cases, the individualized dashboards we provide you in awork may no longer be sufficient to collect and present all the data you need. For exactly such cases (and countless other possible applications), you can now create your own dashboards with the data from your workspace that is important to you.</p>

<p><strong>It may sound complicated, but it's not.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So that you are not left on your own, we have created <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O93v186FPHU2IlcNZyePkFIkpaCo3ZCwSHh_0gXcE6k/edit#gid=0"">code templates</a> for you, which you can already use in this form to create your custom dashboard. If you need other data or formatting, you only have to adapt the template slightly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To build reports and overviews in external tools, you first need an API key for your workspace. You can get this under&nbsp;<em>Settings/Integrations.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""60px""} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here you have to create a new client application for your custom dashboard. You can name it anything you want, and you can close the window after adding a URL (you don't have to enter anything else here).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After creating the client application, it will be displayed in the list of your clients at the bottom of the integration page. Now you can manage the API keys of your client application via the<em>&nbsp;three-dot symbol.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""60px""} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just click on the green&nbsp;<em>plus</em>&nbsp;to generate an API key for your custom dashboard. Then copy it to your clipboard to paste it into the following code templates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you have your API key, you can paste it into our template. You have read-only access to this template, but you can easily duplicate the template to get the code in your own file.</p>

<p>The template gives you a direct overview of your <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/awork-allgemein/projektmanagement-fuer-teams-worauf-kommt-es-wirklich-an/"">projects</a>. This can be filtered by the customer and contains information like status, responsible person, and progress. Of course, the data can be further calculated, or data from other tools can be added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the second spreadsheet, you will find the settings for this dashboard. Here are only two specifications made by us: The position of the table and a filter option by the customer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can enter the customer name here, as it is specified in awork, and thereby only display projects of this customer. Further columns for settings can be added without any problems.</p>

<p>There you can see the code that generates the data in the table. For the crucial code blocks, we have added explanations and descriptions as comments.</p>

<p>The most important thing to start with is to insert your API key so that you can display data from your workspace. Here you can see where to insert the API key:</p>

<p>Our task actions help you add all the details to a task at once without taking your fingers off the keyboard. Just type the desired action with a slash (/-commands) after the name of your task, and awork will add the specified details. For example, you can use the / command to assign agents or set custom deadlines. For example: If your deadline is April ninth, you simply type&nbsp;<strong>/9.4.</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>/9-4.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Whether you manage projects, develop software or work in marketing, there are recurring tasks everywhere. We've now made them even more user-friendly: Just enter the start date for the first recurrence, the frequency of the recurrence, and the scheduled due date of the task, then watch awork take care of the rest. From now on, in addition to the date, you can also specify the exact time at which the recurring task should be created.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example: As a project manager, you have a kickoff meeting with your team every month, for which you have to prepare a presentation. In awork, you can now set a task to be created for you at eight o'clock on the first day of every month.</p>

<p>The awork app was designed to give you full control over all your projects and tasks, even when you're on the go. This allows you to quickly and conveniently create new tasks or check off completed ones at any time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The focus of the app is on simple and fast handling for mobile work, such as from the train or for a quick look at the to-dos on the way to work. The app, therefore, deliberately does without more complex functions, such as managing settings or kanban views. Instead, the awork app comes with smartphone-oriented features, such as push messages.</p>

<p>As you have already experienced in the web tool, you can also manage your projects with multiple lists in the awork app. Depending on how you design and divide the projects and lists, you have an incredible number of possibilities to work productively. Since we have already introduced you to the <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/wie-geht-das/mit-der-marc-andreessen-methode-produktiv-in-awork/"">Marc Andreessen Method</a>, today we want to show you more concepts for working productively in awork. Spoiler: With awork and the new app, you can implement pretty much any method and any productivity concept. Even when planning private projects, like the next trip or a big party, can be perfectly executed in the awork app.</p>

<p>Do you already know the Getting Things Done (GTD) principle? This method can also be implemented flawlessly in awork!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Consultant David Allen's method is based on the idea of simply writing down all the thousands of things we still need to get done, along with the ideas that buzz through our heads every day, thus taking the pressure off our minds. That is, every time a new task comes up, it is consistently written down. No matter how small the to-do is, everything gets written down.</p>

<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Afterward, you can assign priorities to the to-dos and work through all tasks one after the other. By always writing everything down consistently, no task can get lost. This allows you to finally concentrate on one thing at a time. Thus, the GTD principle in the awork app creates total relief in the brain and efficiency when working through tasks.</p>

<h2>The five fundamental steps of the GTD system</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GTD is based on five elementary steps: Collect, Process, Organize, Review, Do. I.e., in the first step, you collect all the tasks that come up. An example of this could be creating a list called ""Inbox"" in your awork project. Thanks to the app, you can also write all to-dos that pop up in between directly into your inbox list while you are on the go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the second step, you can process and organize the tasks. In relation to your project in awork, this means that you prioritize your tasks and distribute them in lists. You can create different lists for this purpose. We suggest a ""Next"" list for all tasks that you can work on next and a ""Someday/Maybe"" list for all tasks that are not so important but should be done someday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":60} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":18485,""sizeSlug"":""large"",""linkDestination"":""none""} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img src=""https://www.awork.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/awork-app-screens1-1024x602.jpg"" alt=""Mit dem GTD-System kannst du all deine To-Dos sauber in Listen sortieren und sorgfältig bearbeiten."" class=""wp-image-18485"" title=""Mit dem GTD-System kannst du all deine To-Dos sauber in Listen sortieren und sorgfältig bearbeiten.""/><figcaption>With the GTD system, you can sort all your to-dos neatly into lists and work on them carefully.</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":60} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>David Allen calls such lists action lists. They have this name because it is important that you are specific about your tasks. So instead of ""Promote the new awork app,"" you would create to-dos such as ""Social media posts,"" ""Send newsletter,"" and ""Run ad.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The last two steps in GTD are Review and Process. So you should go through your GTD project in awork regularly and make sure you have filed all to-dos neatly. To do this, it makes sense to create a waiting list and a done list. If a to-do is waiting for feedback, for example, it goes into the waiting list. A task that you have completed goes into the done list.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another possibility for structured planning in awork are lists for the respective days of the week. This principle can be very useful in content marketing, for example. From Monday to Friday (or even until Sunday), you distribute all tasks to each day or to the respective list. Everything else, i.e., tasks that will only be completed in one of the next weeks, end up or remain in a separate list. This list could be called ""Ideas"" or ""To-Dos"".</p>

So hast du jederzeit die Möglichkeit, spontane Ideen dort einzutragen und vergisst nichts!""/><figcaption>If you are a marketing manager, for example, you can create a collection of ideas in the awork app. This way, you can enter spontaneous ideas there at any time and won't forget anything!</figcaption></figure>

<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the start of the week, this principle distributes all of this week's tasks over the upcoming days. Here, too, the app comes into play. Finally, the mobile view allows you to quickly check the to-dos on Sunday evening or in the morning on the way to work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The work with lists for this week, next month, and another list for ideas works very similarly. Regularly at the start of the week, the tasks are distributed to the lists. New tasks that arise during the week end up in the list for this week or in the collection of ideas, depending on their urgency.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":60} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

<h2>Always keep an eye on private to-dos as well</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can also use the same methods to plan private projects and keep track of tasks. For example, the GTD principle is a good way to write down and work through all the tasks you have to do in your daily life. Whether it's a tax return, a call to the dentist, or shopping for the weekend barbecue - with a private GTD project in awork, nothing will be forgotten.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can also plan one-off, larger projects in awork. Do you have a big trip coming up? Do you have to organize a wedding? With the list function in awork, you can manage such projects perfectly. And the practical thing is: With the app, all to-dos are always visible, even when you're on the go.</p>

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>For example, you can<strong>&nbsp;guide the progress of your project</strong>&nbsp;by setting milestones for intermediate results or marking an important release as a milestone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Alternatively, you can determine the&nbsp;<strong>end of a project phase</strong>&nbsp;by using milestones as clear deadlines.

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's best to begin by defining in the team how you will handle milestones: What happens if&nbsp;<strong>deadlines are exceeded</strong>? Which&nbsp;<strong>intermediate results</strong>&nbsp;should be marked as milestones and reviewed together?</p>

18837,"Recording Working Hours via an App: 5 Reasons to Start Now","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since the ECJ's ruling, it's clear that working time recording is coming. As soon as the Bundestag passes the corresponding law, every company will be obliged to systematically document the working hours of its employees. This means that in just a few months, every company will need a <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/awork-allgemein/zeiterfassung-in-der-praxis-molchkragen-media-nutzt-die-zeiterfassung-in-awork/"">working time recording solution</a>. In the following, you'll learn: Why you'll be best off with working time recording via an app and how you can implement the whole thing in awork and the partner tool timeBro.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Recording working time via an app: modern work requires location-independent solutions<br>Previous solutions for recording working hours, such as chip cards or terminals, are location-bound. They are only suitable for checking attendance. But since physical presence is becoming less and less important in modern work, companies need solutions that also work for home office or while in the field - in other words, remotely. Nothing could be more obvious than tying working time recording to the respective work device and using a <a href=""https://www.awork.io/produkt/zeiterfassung-app/"">working time recording app for this purpose</a>.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""https://www.awork.io/produkt/zeiterfassung-app/"">Recording working hours via app</a> always has a price. Can't it also be done for free? The idea of at least finding a free solution for an excessive burden enforced by law is understandable. But companies that have their employees fill out Excel spreadsheets or timesheets are tying their own hands with extra work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ECJ ruling requires that the timesheets be ""accessible"" - that is, that authorities and works councils can view them. This means that, in the case of tables, they would have to be collected, checked, consolidated, dated, and filed accessibly. Inquiries, reminders, and warnings also create disruptive meaningless communication.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the requirements defined by the ECJ, recorded times must in the future be ""objective,"" ""reliable,"" and ""accessible.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Accessibility is ensured by entering and transparently managing all times in an app.</li><li>""Objective"" means, in the best case, only the recording of dates and times. However, depending on the law's implementation, the recording of activity types and comments on activities can be added. In time tracking apps, corresponding functions are a matter of course. That means you can track exactly how much working time was spent on which projects or tasks.</li><li>""Reliability"" refers to, on the one hand, protecting recorded times from subsequent manipulation. Tables and timesheets cannot really meet this requirement. But it also refers to the timeliness, completeness, and accuracy of times. Let's take the good old-fashioned entry of working times into an Excel template again. Be honest: Who remembers to enter the working times conscientiously into a spreadsheet every day? The result: The subsequent recording at the end of the week or even month is always inaccurate. Good apps offer automatic time measurement or notifications that remind employees to record their time every day.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Work time tracking is about the start, end, and total of working time. On the other hand, project time recording determines the distribution of working time among different projects, tasks, processes, or customers. Up until now, it has mainly been service providers such as agencies, IT companies, law firms, or architecture and engineering firms that record project times. It helps them to calculate projects profitably and plan their processes efficiently. But project time recording is also immensely valuable for other service providers and self-employed people as an insight-oriented form of working time recording.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Without question, knowledge of project times would also be very useful for any other company. Since working time recording has to be made anyway, and it is only a small step to project time recording, why not use the time to collect data via an app that helps optimize the respective business?</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the time the law comes into effect in a few months, all reasonable app providers will integrate the recording of pure working hours. Since there will certainly be a demand for working time recording-only apps, this will give rise to separate product versions and packages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While existing customers of project time tracking apps will get these features as a free update, anyone looking for a solution only at the start of the law will have to pay a reasonable price for this benefit.</p>

<p>Agile project management is characterized by a project (or product) being developed step by step. The team focuses on the next most important steps and works together in a self-organized and interdisciplinary way. By dividing the project into several stages, it is also possible to react flexibly to changes during the project.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The waterfall method is, in principle, the opposite of the agile approach. Already at the beginning of the project, the entire project scope is defined. In addition, it is assumed that a completed project phase initiates the next one and that each phase builds on the other. Although this approach has less flexibility than with an agile method, the planning reliability is much higher. Therefore, the waterfall method is best suited for projects in which, for example, precise guidelines or high-quality standards must be adhered to. Originally, the model originates from the construction and production industries. Especially in these industries, highly structured processes have to be followed to avoid expensive changes (sometimes these changes become impossible at the end).</p>

<p>IIn autopilot, you should choose the agile mode for all projects that don't have a fixed schedule. So for these projects, you are more oriented to the available working hours than to fixed deadlines (e.g., Kanban or Scrum). The waterfall method is best suited if you already know deadlines and fixed responsibilities. So if you work with <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/neues-feature/visuelle-planung/"">milestones and a Gantt chart </a>and the time factor is critical, the waterfall method is the better choice.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All further mailings are based on a sophisticated system. Which emails you or one of your team members receives depends on various factors. Autopilot sends only the emails and information that are most relevant to that person.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Basically, smart mailings distinguish between notices and alerts. Notices can contain announcements about upcoming to-dos or info about project progress. Warnings are sent whenever the project could get out of hand. In this case, for example, a deadline was not met or the time budget was exceeded. You can always recognize these important warnings by the red alert symbol in the email header. </p>

<p>Hey, thanks for interviewing us. We are&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.visual-jump.com/"">Visual Jump</a>. A design lab from Marbach am Neckar near Stuttgart. Our main business is corporate communication. We help our clients to position themselves and their brand perfectly in the market and to develop the right communication strategies and means. With the help of our design craft, these strategies are then implemented cross-medially. Here we do not distinguish whether online or offline, but whether it makes sense or not. From small businesses to gastronomy to city events - we are involved everywhere.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For us as designers, an <a href=""https://www.awork.io/"">intuitive but flexible interface</a> is important and necessary. The visual appearance also plays a big role, so that working with the tool is fun. We saw these factors with you and firstly tried out the <a href=""https://www.awork.io/pricing/"">free version</a>. After a few projects, we quickly realized that awork is the tool for us. We still miss a few features here and there that would support our workflow even better, but since you are working so diligently on awork, we are sure that there is still a lot to come.</p>

When exactly do we work on which insert issue, when are the deadlines for customer input, printing, and collections. Here, the division into individual jobs for the same customer is very helpful to keep track of us and for billing. We are also currently working on a customer's webshop, where the division with different task types and lists and the assignment of tasks to different team members is very useful.</p>

<p>Currently, our favorite feature is <a href=""https://www.awork.io/"">time tracking</a>. Therefore, we have already thought of a few things that would be helpful for flexible working models like ours (for example, setting and defining the daily working time, which is currently fixed at 8 hours) and one or two nice-to-haves (like colored distinctions in the display for a faster overview in the timeline). In addition, we are just making friends with the really practical task lists and create project-by-project packages that we can then use in the long run.</p>

<p>Which to-dos are coming up this week? Did I complete all tasks last week? What times did I record last month? From now on you don't have to worry about these questions anymore, because awork takes care of that for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What was previously known as ""the weekly"" and ""monthly summary' and the time recording reminder are now: <em>Weekly Briefing, Weekly Report, and Monthly Report</em>. And the best part: awork creates the new briefings automatically and sends them to you and your team members automatically via email - without any extra effort!</p>

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>From now on, every Monday morning, you will receive a weekly briefing about your upcoming tasks and projects. This way, you start the new week perfectly organized, see at a glance what needs to be done and save valuable time in your weekly planning. Nothing stands in the way of a productive week.</li><li>So that you know exactly how productive your week was, you will now receive a weekly report every Friday, in which your recorded times and tasks from the last week are summarized. So you have a great overview of your completed to-dos and start directly with a good feeling into the weekend!</li><li>All good things come in threes: In addition to the weekly briefing and report, you will now also receive a monthly report on your recorded times and tasks on the 1st of the following month. This makes the time-consuming creation of monthly reviews a thing of the past, and you have the progress of the past month in black and white - without any additional effort. Pretty nice, isn't it?</li></ul>

18929,"Optimize Your Workflow With Kanban – “Stop Starting, and Start Finishing!”","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kanban… You've probably heard of it before. But what exactly is Kanban?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It all started in 1947 with the smart idea of a Japanese car manufacturer:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To achieve shorter lead times and avoid bottlenecks, an engineer from Toyota developed the Kanban system. He was inspired by the stock plan in the supermarket: reordering only takes place when a product stock runs out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":60} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can apply the same principle to your work in projects: You only start a new task when the previous one has been completed. This way, you avoid that too many tasks are started in parallel and not reliably finished.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The word Kanban is Japanese and means ""card,"" so this method consists of a card system. The principle was related to software development in 2007 by David Anderson, from which the current Kanban method has evolved.</p>

<h2>How does Kanban work?&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kanban is an <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/lesenswert/projektmanagement-methoden/"">agile method</a> for organizing work. It is flexibly adaptable, creates clarity, and helps you to improve your workflow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kanban board is the primary component of this method. You can display a board classically as a pinboard or in a suitable project management software like awork. The latter offers the great advantage that your mobile board is always available for everyone and from everywhere.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":60} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each Kanban board contains colored task cards for different topics, as well as three process columns, which show the processing status of the respective task.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the far left, you'll find the backlog, the place where you collect all pending to-dos. In the middle, you will find the currently in progress tasks - also called WIP (""Work in Progress""). On the far right, you will find all completed tasks.</p>

<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Depending on your project, you can add as many intermediate steps as you like, such as a review column to check your tasks or discuss them with your team. Thanks to the rankings, you can also prioritize tasks in the individual columns to get an accurate understanding of the current tasks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a Kanban board, you are spared confusing lists with jumbled tasks; instead, you keep a very clear overview of all tasks. This is because all to-dos are processed in small steps and successively moved in the Kanban board columns if the task status changes.</p>

<h2><strong>Core practices of the Kanban method</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now that you've learned the basics, we'll introduce you to the six core practices. This way, you can work even more efficiently with your team!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><li><strong><em><strong>Design:</strong>&nbsp;</em></strong>The Kanban board is used to visualize your tasks. It is important that the columns for the processing status are clearly defined. Otherwise, you can design your board freely. For example, in <a href=""https://www.awork.io/en/"">awork</a> add suitable photos and graphics to your tasks.&nbsp;</li><li><strong><em>Limitation:</em></strong> In order for your team to establish a perfect workflow, you should limit the tasks in the individual columns. That means each column may contain a maximum defined number of cards.&nbsp;</li><li><strong><em>Control:</em></strong> In order to improve the workflow, you and your team should keep an eye on important variables such as throughput times and queues. In this way, you will quickly recognize where there is still potential for improvement, and, based on this, you can optimize individual variables in a targeted manner.</li><li><strong><em>Regulation</em></strong>: The limited tasks and defined columns are part of the regulation and help you and your team to make all workflows more efficient, thanks to clear structures. These rules should be visible to all members at any time on the Kanban board.</li><li><strong><em>Cadences:</em></strong> These are meetings where you can give each other individual feedback as a team. Cadences should be held regularly so that each individual can work on and improve their skills.</li><li><strong><em>Kaizen:</em></strong> This word comes from Japanese and is formed from the syllables Kai (change) and Zen (for the better). The kaizen theory has the background of going through a continuous process of improvement and constantly working to optimize a company step by step.</li></ol>

<h2><strong>Kanban vs. Scrum</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Between Kanban and the agile development method Scrum, some similarities can be found. Both are used in self-organized teams and rely on transparency as well as a constant change of the original setting by evaluating relevant variables. A division of individual tasks into smaller units can also be found in both methods to facilitate the workflow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":60} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But what exactly differentiates Kanban from Scrum?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Kanban gives you more freedom: Iterations, prioritizations, cross-functional teams, and other techniques are optional - these applications are mandatory in Scrum.</li><li>As an indicator for planning and process improvement, Kanban boards use lead times, in Scrum, it is team velocities.</li><li>If required capacities are free, you can work on new requirements with your team and the Kanban method - in Scrum, this is not possible during a Sprint.</li><li>In Kanban, no roles are predefined, but in Scrum, there are three predefined roles at the beginning of a project.&nbsp;</li><li>Several teams or even individuals can share Kanban boards and continuously develop them further. The sprint backlogs in Scrum only belong to one team and are deleted after each sprint.</li></ul>

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do you want to really take off with the Kanban method? Then awork is the perfect companion for you and your team. The Kanban board in awork contains a single column for each task status; with the&nbsp;<em>plus button</em>&nbsp;you can quickly add additional columns. I.e., you can customize all columns and add more as you like - so you can tailor the board perfectly to your team's process. For example, if you are part of a marketing team, you could create an additional process column for your research work.&nbsp;</p>

18945,"Time Tracking in the Home Office – Big Boss Is Watching You, or Is He?","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Does the following scenario sound familiar to you? Due to current circumstances, you are forced to move your workplace from the office to the home office. The contact with your favorite colleagues is dwindling, and also, the daily chat at the coffee machine is gone. Suddenly you're even missing the stupid jokes of your colleagues. Instead, you sit alone at home in an untidy mess… And then your boss asks the team to document working hours. What's that all about?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Time tracking is a highly debated topic: some strongly advocate it, others consider it absolute nonsense. In this article, we contrast both perspectives and explain why time tracking makes sense despite all the prejudices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""20px""} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyone who deals with the topic of time tracking knows it. A manager who's downright afraid of the home office and is frantically clinging to the ideas of the past. At all costs, they make sure that everyone works well. If a home office is to be used, then it must be combined with meticulous time tracking. Employees are therefore forced to record their working hours. There is too much concern that they will watch Netflix during working hours.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""60px""} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Time tracking as a means of control. This is precisely why so many employees rightly have a negative attitude toward the principle of time tracking. This is understandable because control contradicts New Work and the ownership mentality - no one likes to be controlled and spied on. What's more, many see the recording of their working hours as an annoying time waster and don't want to go through the extra work of painstakingly entering every single activity. Some are also afraid of not fully meeting the expected performance, whereas others don't take the principle seriously at all, just like the motto: ""The time clock is part of yesterday's working world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""60px""} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

<h2>Time recording? All nonsense! Or is it?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""20px""} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All these prejudices make one thing clear: Since the reason for time recording is often communicated only inadequately or not at all, many employees see it as spying on their attendance times. Against this background, it is clear that no one wants to enter their working hours constantly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""60px""} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The actual purpose of time recording lies somewhere else entirely: The goal should be to be able to record productive times and to enable an allocation to individual jobs and projects. It is totally helpful when time tracking serves this purpose instead of serving as a nonsensical monitoring tool. For example, time tracking helps agency management better estimate the actual staffing needs of a project or even take timely countermeasures in the event of budget overruns. Sounds logical, doesn't it?</p>

<h2>What are the real advantages of time tracking - especially in the home office?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""20px""} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We see many advantages in time tracking, as long as the purpose of this method has been discussed in advance and it is not used to control employees. In the long run, recording working hours can help both employees and the company as a whole.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Time tracking is also worthwhile for you in times of remote work. Statistically,<a href=""https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/home-office-die-meisten-arbeitnehmer-machen-ueberstunden-16936740.html""> people tend to work more</a> in a home office than in an office. Instead of having to do complex calculations, time tracking helps you make overtime clear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""60px""} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, recording working hours can help promote self-motivating working. Especially in times of New Work, this aspect is no longer irrelevant. Instead of a rigid, directive-based daily routine, employees in the home office should be given the opportunity to organize their time freely. If all working hours are now recorded in relation to tasks instead of just attendance, time-wasters can be better unmasked. This helps to use one's own working time better and thus to manage one's own capacities. If you want to devote a large part of your time to a specific topic, you also need a method to ensure that you succeed in doing so.</p>

<p>Our co-founder Tobias has also been tracking his working time regularly for years:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""><p>""I also track the time I need to complete my tasks. This gives me a detailed insight into which areas of the company I spend my time on. In addition to a much better sense of the actual effort required, I naturally also know the costs of the individual activities. Most importantly - and I would like to emphasize this point - I always have to think about my priorities.</p><p>For example, if I resolve to spend at least 50 percent of my working time on strategically relevant topics, I get an immediate assessment of whether I have been successful in doing so. I can also identify topic areas that need new or different process solutions. As an agile team, we want to invest time in projects that actually move us forward. This makes time tracking an irreplaceable tool in the continuous improvement of our productivity.""</p><cite>Tobias Hagenau, Co-Founder awork</cite></blockquote>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So time tracking also answers the question, ""What do you waste your time on?"": As time-wasters are cleverly exposed, you can improve your self-control and increase productivity. In addition, a logical breakdown of labor costs becomes more transparent for customers - you work more lucratively and are able to determine individual prices better.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order for your company to benefit from the principle of time tracking, the following two criteria must be met: In order not to provoke any misunderstandings, it is important that all parties involved are informed about the benefits of time recording. Therefore, it is essential that the purpose of this method is clearly communicated before implementation. Also, you should choose a practical tool (such as <a href=""https://www.awork.io/en/"">awork</a>) that makes time tracking super easy. Everyone involved should be able to use it properly, so there is no extra work at all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Furthermore, it can be useful to offer a workshop for the introduction of a time tracking system, in which the benefits, as well as the advantages of time tracking for the employees and the company, are clearly communicated. The purpose of this workshop is to promote employee acceptance and create transparency.</p>

<p>Do you want to take the first step and become friends with time tracking? Good decision! awork is the perfect tool for your team. Thanks to integrated time tracking, you can not only evaluate recorded times super easily but also calculate them instantly. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The time tracking in awork is directly integrated into the project work. It fits seamlessly into your workflow and does not require any additional effort. In total, there are three options for time tracking in awork.</p>

<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One way to start the time tracking in awork is the timer. You can start your timer for time tracking not only within your projects or on individual tasks but also via the global time tracking. You can activate this from anywhere in awork. It is especially useful for quickly starting new tasks, for example, when you answer a call. Long searching within your projects is a thing of the past. Here you can start directly with just one click and add details even afterward.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A second possibility is to record the working time afterward via the time recording window. There you can easily add the date of your task as well as a start and end time and enter details such as the activity, projects, or notes.</p>

<p>You can also integrate appointments from external calendars, such as Google, Microsoft, or iCloud, into you awork time tracking. Using the icons in each appointment, you can distinguish between the different providers and make a time recording from it with a simple click on the appointment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All recorded working times can be found in awork in the area <em>My recorded times</em>. In this overview, you can switch between the three views <em>My Day</em>, <em>My Week</em>, and <em>My Times</em>. The loading circle on the left shows you how much of your daily working time you have already recorded. All entries can be easily edited, duplicated, or deleted at any time using  Drag-and-Drop so you always have an overview of your times. </p>

<p>Basically, you can use Zapier to connect over 1,000 apps to awork. And, you can do it without any programming knowledge! We have already created a few of the most popular&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.awork.io/zapier-integration/"">Zaps</a>&nbsp;(that's what these connections are called) for you. With these templates, it's even easier for you to become more productive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, it is also possible to create your own zaps. This is also very easy! If you're interested,&nbsp;<a href=""https://support.awork.io/hc/de/articles/360000553449-Zapier-Integration-einrichten?_ga=2.52697121.863177587.1550430972-431564652.1547626432"">here's</a>&nbsp;a guide to setting up integrations.</p>

<h2 id=""funktionen"">How does Zapier work, and what do I have to do?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zapier works in two ways: You can get information from awork (tasks or time tracking) and use it in another application. You can also use information from another application to create tasks in awork.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a few short steps, you connect awork with Zapier. First, You need a&nbsp;<a href=""https://zapier.com/apps/awork/integrations"">Zapier account</a>&nbsp;(the free version is sufficient for now) and, of course, your&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.awork.io/"">awork account&nbsp;</a>(again, the free version is sufficient for now). Then select the two programs you want to connect and follow the instructions to set up your new Zap. Don't forget to test it later.</p>

<p>To give you a taste of what<a href=""https://zapier.com/apps/awork/integrations""> awork can do in combination with Zapier</a>, here are a few of our Zap templates.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, how about having new appointments automatically added to your Google Calendar as soon as you create a task with a deadline in awork?

<p>A new comment on your blog, but you don't have time to address it right now, and then poof, it's forgotten.

<p>It's time for an awork update again! 🤩 In the last month, we have been working intensively on improving existing features.

<p>We regularly conduct usability tests and listen to your feedback. The result of this is a well-thought-out concept for awork development planning, which will be implemented step by step.</p>

<p>The optimization of existing functions and workflows is just as much an integral part of this as the development of new features. After all, attention to detail is ultimately what makes a great tool.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yeah!, from now on you can export <a href=""https://support.awork.io/de/articles/5371614-arbeiten-mit-aufgabenlisten"">task lists</a> in a project or a task view as Excel file. The export contains all task details, such as description, tags, associated project, recorded time, activity, etc. - so you can easily process your data in Excel, e.g. for individual evaluations or for printing.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""https://support.awork.io/de/articles/5396875-tags-verwenden"">Tags in awork</a> now have a free choice of colors. To make them even more readable, we have also adapted the design a bit. Also, tags are now renameable, so if you want to change a tag, you don't have to delete it and create a new one - just click on the edit button. How cool is that?!</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dein Dashboard kannst du in awork komplett individuell anpassen und z.B. verschiedene Aufgabenansichten als Widgets speichern. Die Aufgabenansichten, die du auf dem Dashboard verwendest, kannst du ab jetzt auch direkt aus den Widget-Einstellungen heraus bearbeiten. Der “Umweg” über das Aufgabenansichten-Modul ist nun also nicht mehr nötig und du siehst die angepasste Liste sofort auf dem Dashboard – super praktisch!</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vor allem bei Projektmanagern, die viele Projekte und verschiedene Teams im Blick behalten müssen, sind die eben genannten Aufgabenansichten ein beliebtes Feature. Mit unserem Sommer-Update gibt es neue Filter für die Aufgabenansichten. Du kannst jetzt mit neuen Optionen für Aufgabenansichten nach Aufgaben ohne Deadline sowie nach Aufgaben via Kunden-Tags filtern.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Das ist besonders praktisch, weil <a href=""https://www.awork.io/blog/aufgabenlisten-aufgaben-planen-in-awork/"">Aufgaben ohne feste Deadline </a>besonders leicht unter den Tisch fallen – mit der neuen Filteroption bei Aufgabenlisten gehört das jedoch der Vergangenheit an, denn du kannst dir diese projektübergreifend mit einem Klick anzeigen lassen.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Auch der Filter für Kunden-Tags ist super hilfreich. Wenn du z.B. einen spezifischen Tag für Neukunden nutzt, dann kannst du dir über die neue Filteroption der Aufgabenlisten direkt alle Aufgaben aus deinen Neukunden-Projekten anzeigen lassen, ohne jeden Kunden dieser Kategorie einzeln auswählen zu müssen. We like!&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unter&nbsp;<em>Meine Aufgaben</em>&nbsp;kannst du jetzt ganz einfach neue Aufgaben zu gruppierten Listen hinzufügen. Der entsprechende Wert für die Gruppe (z.B. fällig nächste Woche) wird der Aufgabe direkt hinzugefügt – je nachdem in welcher Aufgabenliste du gerade bist.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Außerdem kannst du deine Aufgaben dort nun auch nach Startdatum sortieren. Diese Sortiermöglichkeit gibt es übrigens auch unter den Aufgabenansichten.</p>

<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In der Timeline siehst du nur Aufgaben, die ein Start- und Enddatum haben. Alle anderen To-Dos erscheinen daneben in der Liste<em>&nbsp;ungeplante Aufgaben</em>. Diese Aufgaben-Leiste kannst du ab sofort via Drag-and-Drop auf deine gewünschte Breite ziehen. So können auch lange Aufgabennamen gut erkannt werden.</p>

<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mit awork kannst du erfasste Zeiten bzw. Zeitauswertungen ganz einfach mit gängigen Rechnungs-Tools weiterverarbeiten. Die Authentifizierung für unsere lexoffice-Integration haben wir nun umgestellt. Ab jetzt kann eine Integration nur noch via oAuth 2.0 eingerichtet werden. Dieses Verfahren ist nicht nur sicherer, sondern auch komfortabler – das manuelle Kopieren des API-Tokens ist nicht mehr nötig. Bereits bestehende Integrationen funktionieren natürlich weiterhin. Kleines Goodie am Rande: Eine neu angelegte Rechnung über die lexoffice-Integration öffnet sich dadurch jetzt direkt im Bearbeitungsmodus.</p>

<p>Außerdem haben wir uns bei einer&nbsp; Vielzahl an Mini-Optimierungen um ein besseres Nutzererlebnis bemüht. Dazu zählt z.B. eine intuitivere Eingabe von Benachrichtungen in den Automatisierungen, eine verbesserte Ansicht der Board-Spalten auch auf größeren Bildschirmen, eine Darkmode-Ansicht des Notiz-Widgets uvm.</p>

18987,"Project Management for Teams: What Really Matters?","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whether you're an agency, event planner, or start-up - planning projects is part of your everyday work. Numerous to-dos and deadlines accompany every project. With this, a project seldom comes alone, so in addition to good teamwork, organizational talent is also required. How quickly is a deadline, a small to-do, or a comment from a colleague forgotten? The right <a href=""https://www.awork.io/en"">project management</a> can help!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Project management tools, such as awork, have been developed for flexible and precise team collaboration. The great advantage of such smart helpers is that all information for each team member is bundled centrally in one place, and thanks to the modern cloud solution (SaaS), there is also no need to download the software.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The only question that remains is: What do teams actually want from a project management tool like awork? And what do they really need?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>

<h2><strong>This is how project management works today: digitally and flexibly</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The world of work is changing, and in many offices, traditional structures are being broken down: Some colleagues work from their home office or from the café around the corner. In some offices, there are no longer fixed working hours, and arrangements with colleagues are increasingly being made digitally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some companies are even testing the 4-day work-week with success. Microsoft, for example, introduced the 4-day week on a trial basis in August 2019 and reported that there was much to suggest that shorter weekly working hours increased employee productivity. Accordingly, the conclusion would be: Those with less time on their hands work more quickly and purposefully.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":60} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are similar developments in the area of flexwork. According to a 2019 study by the <a href=""https://www.trendence.com/reports/new-work/flexibles-arbeiten"">Trendence Institute</a>, 79 percent of the young professionals surveyed said that they are already offered the opportunity to work in a home office. And as many as 64.9 percent believe that they are more productive and can deliver better work results in a home office.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When colleagues are not working in the same place, communication with the team becomes even more important. This is because the <a href=""https://www.trendence.com/reports/new-work/flexibles-arbeiten"">study</a> also showed that half of the respondents believe (51.3 percent) that remote work has a negative impact on the team. At the same time, the study concluded that modern cloud solutions or communication tools, such as Slack, are far too little used in many offices.&nbsp;</p>

In order to support teams in this change, <a href=""https://www.awork.io/produkt/projektmanagement-software/"">smart project management tools</a> are available that address the needs, simplify complex and confusing work processes, and at the same time promote communication with the team.</p>

<h2><strong>Project management with awork - perfect for your team</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whether your team consists of five or 30 colleagues, the challenges are ultimately the same. The tool must not be too complicated, but it must still be complex and accessible to every team member.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, there are the new requirements for collaboration in a modern team, keyword New Work. Today, project managers have to coach their colleagues more than they lead, enable more than they determine, and steer more than they control when it comes to processes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":60} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collaboration within the team and the self-organization of each individual are therefore becoming more important. Digital tools are playing an increasingly important role here because, with a large number of projects and challenges in the team, the overview must always be maintained. This is impossible without agile methods and smart project management tools.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyone works differently, so there are several ways to plan projects in awork. You can either create your tasks in <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/neues-feature/jetzt-neu-individuelle-dashboards-in-awork/"">smart lists</a>, work on flexible <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/wie-geht-das/to-do-listen-richtig-nutzen-und-noch-produktiver-in-awork-arbeiten/"">Kanban boards</a>, or <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/neues-feature/visuelle-planung/"">plan your projects visually</a> in the timeline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Kanban board shows in a central place which topics are in focus and what should be done in a timely manner. Team members not only have an overview of their own to-dos, but it is also immediately visible how busy team colleagues are and whether they need support. This is also very practical and can help to reduce headaches in case someone is sick.</p>

<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If too many to-dos are ""stuck"" at the same time or progress is slow, weaknesses in the work process become apparent even before the project team has the feeling that a project is not running smoothly. This is one of the great strengths of the Kanban board: It gives a quick insight into the project status.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Especially in teams, there are more extensive projects where several to-dos come together. How about a visual schedule for such projects to get a good overview also in terms of time?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":60} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/neues-feature/visuelle-planung/"">visual planning</a> in awork you can display all project tasks in a timeline and set milestones. This way, each team member can see at a glance when individual tasks need to be completed and how much time has been scheduled for each to-do. Just add a start date and a deadline to your tasks, and the task will be displayed directly in the Timeline. Of course, you can also create new tasks in the Timeline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most convenient thing about visual scheduling with the Timeline is that you can identify dependency problems early on. If a task is waiting for another one to be completed, you can represent this dependency with an arrow. This helps to meet deadlines and to identify problems in time.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mobile working is no longer a rarity these days. It is, therefore, all the more important that your project management tool is always with you on the go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/awork-allgemein/arbeitszeiterfassung-per-app/"">awork app</a>, you are always up to date, even on the go. You can create tasks, manage projects, coordinate with your colleagues or quickly <a href=""https://www.awork.io/produkt/zeiterfassung-app/?_ga=2.123151691.1904980593.1573727138-1578234624.1573727138&amp;_gac=1.3460868.1571929329.EAIaIQobChMI2JnSiJW15QIVyKwYCh06gwmrEAAYASAAEgJEBPD_BwE"">start time tracking</a>. This makes team communication quick and easy, even when you're on the go. Simply tag your colleagues with the @ sign, and they will receive a notification directly in the tool and also by e-mail. Your colleagues will then get to the right task in awork with one click and can reply to you immediately.</p>

<h2><strong>Time is Money? Time tracking and time evaluations</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of time tracking, it's a difficult topic. Some are afraid of control, and others demonize time tracking because it is not a measurement criterion for the creative industry, and still others criticize the wasted time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, there are also people who have identified a number of time wasters through time tracking tools and have ultimately <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/awork-allgemein/zeiterfassung-in-der-praxis-molchkragen-media-nutzt-die-zeiterfassung-in-awork/"">become more productive</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since physical presence is becoming less and less important in modern work, companies need solutions that also work in the home office. Therefore, the ability to track time - at best directly on projects or tasks - also belongs in a smart project management tool.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":60} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At its core, time tracking is a mechanism to properly record and optimize processes. Working time recording is about the start, end, and total of working time. On the other hand, project time tracking determines the distribution of working time among different projects, tasks, processes, or customers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Time recording should primarily not be used for control purposes but rather for self-assessment.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, a good time recording system should cover the entire working day and record how much time you have spent on which activity. This is the only way to optimize processes.</p>

<p>Of course, to really optimize your workflow, it's not enough to just record your times. They also must also be evaluated. In awork, you have a variety of filter and grouping options to create meaningful <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/neues-feature/jetzt-neu-die-individuelle-zeitauswertung-fuer-dich-und-dein-team/"">time evaluations</a>. Your individual evaluations can be downloaded as Excel or PDF files.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This function is also important for teams. On the one hand, the evaluations can be attached directly to a customer invoice, including logo, on the other hand, the team gets a better overview of the workload and the duration of the individual tasks of the project.</p>

<h2><strong>Tools no one wants to do without</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In every team, there are tools that no one wants to do without. These tools often make working together in a team much easier. However, as the study by the Trendence Institute has shown, such tools are used by too few companies. This makes it all the more important to <a href=""https://www.awork.io/integrationen/"">integrate them into the project management tool</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One popular tool for team communication is Slack, for example. Via Slack, your colleagues can create groups or communicate directly with just one person. In doing so, data can be sent back and forth, helping you keep up to date. Perfect for colleagues in home offices or open-plan offices.</p>

<p>With awork, we pursue a simple goal: to make work organization as easy as possible. That's our driving force every. single. day. 💜</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since the awork bot stretched its antenna and received its signal in early 2019, just over 30,000 teams have created a test account, scheduled projects, organized tasks, and tracked times. Each of these teams sends us an average of one feedback, feature request, or improvement idea.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":60} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All of these ideas are scrutinized and categorized by our team. Together with our own vision of what work organization needs to look like in the future, our product concepts emerge from the pen of our co-founder Lucas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With so many ideas, awork is developing fast, and our roadmap is far from finished. With so many creative ideas, it is sometimes easy to lose sight of the goal: Everything should remain simple</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":60} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To ensure that our users continue to enjoy awork in the future, we have to clean up, smooth out, and standardize every so often. That's exactly what we've been doing over the last few months. On July 19, awork will therefore appear in new splendor. Simplified menus, more understandable templates, quick creation of tasks and times, and much more are the detailed results of our update with the code name ""Unicorn"". But the most important thing is that awork as a whole becomes simpler, clearer, and more understandable - and prettier to look at too (🦄 because who doesn't love beautiful? 😉).</p>

<p>To really give it a thorough go, we've also cleaned up all the accompanying platforms:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Our Help Center will be faster and more straightforward. All articles have been revised for comprehensibility, have new videos to explain them, etc.</li><li>We have moved our API documentation for developers to a new, more navigatable platform.</li><li>Our website got a facelift to be even easier to understand</li><li>We already renewed the status page a few weeks ago to make awork availability even more apparent</li><li>We have tidied up and better explained our data protection documents (order processing contract, privacy policy, etc.)</li></ul>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All of this would be a big step forward in and of itself. ""Unicorn"" is also a kind of springboard into awork's future for us. From here, we can tackle big topics: How will resource planning work in teams between project planning and calendar in the future? How do we work even better with external partners on joint projects? What happens when many people have to work on the same task at the same time? And in how many countries can awork become available this year? We are currently formulating answers to these questions.</p>

<p>Imagine this: Your team is starting off their productive workday - and click - and just like that, they can access all work-related applications with&nbsp;<strong>just one login</strong>. No password chaos and no resets because someone forgot their login data.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To make it even easier and more secure for your team to log in, our <a href=""http://awork.io/"">work management tool</a> now features authentication via single sign-on (SSO).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This allows users to log into <a href=""http://awork.io"">awork</a> with just one existing account without having to create a new account or remembering a new password. From the user's point of view, this is super convenient because each user gets direct access to their applications, and with single sign-on they <strong>only need one password</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every user in your company logs on to their workstation once and can then access all applications for which they have the necessary access rights.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How does this login work in practice? An upstream <strong>identity software</strong> takes over the login process by using a single user identity that has been predefined. <a href=""http://awork.io/"">awork</a> receives a message from the central tool: it shows that the user has sufficient permissions to log in, and the user is then logged into <a href=""http://awork.io/"">awork</a>. His rights are not revoked until they are revoked in the main tool.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To ensure secure login with single sign-on, you link <a href=""http://awork.io/"">awork</a> once with a primary tool, the so-called ""<strong>Identity Provider</strong>"". From an IT perspective, this means that all access rights only have to be managed in one place, which increases user convenience.</p>

<p>One of the major benefits of SSO is <strong>data security</strong>: Your company retains control over all access rights of your users with only one set of credentials. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The system admin no longer has to check every single access for employees but can focus on more important areas of activity thanks to the security provided by the central identity provider.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, single sign-on is a big plus for users, as they only need one <strong>central login</strong> instead of different passwords for their applications. This saves a lot of time and nerves when logging in.</p>

<p>To activate the Microsoft Teams integration, you have to select a so-called connector in MS Teams. To do this, select the MS Teams channel you want to connect to and click on the&nbsp;<em>ellipsis</em>&nbsp;(...) to the right of the channel name. Then click&nbsp;<em>Connector</em>. awork is also now available as an <a href=""https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA200001443?tab=Overview"">app in the Microsoft Office App Store</a>. So you can just search for awork and click on&nbsp;<em>configure</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the next step, just follow the instructions to connect an awork project to MS Teams. You can choose from a list of activities that should be displayed in the channel, e.g., show when a task has been commented on or when a time tracking has been started.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Good to know: You can see if an awork project is connected to MS Teams by a corresponding tag in the project details.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the end of this year, we've added some <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/neues-feature/awork-news-neue-funktionen-im-dezember/"">really cool new features for you and your team</a> to make working in awork even easier: Invoice Tool Integrations!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From now on, you can have your recorded times in awork directly converted into an invoice, edited, and sent to your clients. From now on, we have integrated <a href=""https://support.awork.io/de/articles/5396668-integration-von-rechnungs-tools"">three invoicing tools</a> in awork for you to choose from. Since you can only evaluate your times individually with the premium feature, the integration of invoicing tools is also a premium feature.</p>

<p>With the <a href=""https://www.awork.io/pricing/"">awork Premium Plan</a>, you can not only individually evaluate your recorded times, but from now on, also invoice them directly. We have integrated three invoicing tools:</p>

<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The prerequisite is that you first create a link between the tool and awork. This can be done via the API of the program.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From your time evaluations (you can find them in the menu on the left side under Workspace), you can easily get to the selection of invoicing tools. Alternatively, you can also go to the <a href=""https://support.awork.io/de/articles/5396668-integration-von-rechnungs-tools"">integrations in the awork menu</a> and select an invoice tool.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In your time evaluations, you now have the possibility to select one or more filters that you would like to have evaluated. Then click on the <em>dollar sign</em> and select <em>Create Invoice</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now an extra window opens where you can choose between three invoice tools.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have selected one of the three invoice tools, another window will open, which already offers you a small graphical representation of your billable times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now you can decide (depending on the selected integration) if you want to edit an already existing invoice or if you want to create a new one. In case you are trying this integration for the first time, just select the option in which you create a new invoice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Depending on the filters you have set in your time evaluation, awork will offer you the appropriate choices of items to appear on your invoice.</p>

<p><a href=""https://support.awork.io/de/articles/5396668-integration-von-rechnungs-tools"">In the next step</a>, you can give the invoice a name and set a price for your billable hours. At this point, you also have the possibility to add further positions to your invoice or to delete others. In addition, you can easily sort and arrange the individual positions using drag-and-drop.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>In the fifth step, you can decide if you want your times to be marked as billed or if you just want to ignore this step.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By clicking on <em>Create Invoice</em>, you will be redirected to the corresponding tool.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After you have logged in, you will see your invoice, including your times from awork. Here you still have the possibility to fill in some fields with the required information, such as the customer, the invoice date, or the subject.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you create a new invoice in awork, then choose a meaningful subject, because this name will also be how you find this invoice afterward in awork. This is very useful if you want to change the invoice later and add other positions and times.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In principle, this new feature is beneficial for all awork users who want to continue calculating their times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following initial situation: You are working <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/neues-feature/jetzt-neu-visuelle-und-projektuebergreifende-teamplanung/"">with your team</a> on the creation of a new website for a client. This project, for example, involves some juniors but also a senior graphic designer. This means that your times have to be billed differently since a senior's hours are more expensive than a junior's.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":60} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The client may not only have hired your firm to do this one project, but you are also developing a new online marketing strategy for them at the same time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since the client pays you by the hour, the hours are recorded on the two projects by all the colleagues involved. Thanks to the <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/neues-feature/jetzt-neu-die-individuelle-zeitauswertung-fuer-dich-und-dein-team/"">individual time evaluation</a> in awork, you can show the client a breakdown of the individual employees or the two projects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> With the new feature, you can now also send the customer an invoice directly from the recorded times per project. All you have to do is set the appropriate filters in the <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/neues-feature/jetzt-neu-die-individuelle-zeitauswertung-fuer-dich-und-dein-team/"">time evaluations</a> that should appear on the invoice (e.g., filter by project and by individual employees), and you can then use one of the three invoicing tools to further calculate your times. </p>

<p>In addition to the new<a href=""https://blog.awork.io/neues-feature/jetzt-neu-die-individuelle-zeitauswertung-fuer-dich-und-dein-team/""> time reporting feature</a> in awork, we've also been working on the <a href=""https://support.awork.io/hc/de/articles/360000428149n"">Slack integration feature</a>. Slack is a popular tool among many teams to communicate and update each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One thing is for sure: our Slack integration will make you and your team even more productive. This article will explain precisely how this feature works and how you can connect your awork with Slack.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the Slack integration, you can create tasks in awork, leave comments or start time tracking on a task directly from your Slack chat. This allows you to start project planning directly from your chat, and you don't even have to switch tools to do it!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In your awork, as well as in your Slack channel, you will be able to see who is working on which task along with the task's current status.</p>

<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To activate the Slack integration, you have two options. You can choose the classic way via our main menu and the menu item <em><a href=""https://www.awork.io/integrationen/slack-integration/"">Integrations</a></em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, you can pair your awork with Slack directly via the project view. To do so, select the <em>dot icon</em> next to the respective project. Then you can select the desired Slack channel and specify which activity should be triggered via Slack.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In awork, you must first define which selection options there should be. How about assigning a user, naming a due date, setting a status, or commenting? Back in Slack, you'll then need to onetime verify that you are who you say you are.</p>

<p>What's especially handy is that you can reply directly in Slack to newly created tasks. You can either change the status, set an editor, set a deadline, or comment directly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Would you like to say something about a certain to-do to your colleague Karolin, who has just created three new tasks in awork? With the Slack integration, you no longer have to switch from Slack to awork but can click directly on the <em>Comment</em> button and write down your comments there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":60} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You will then find your comment both in Slack and in your awork - in the right project and under the right task.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The new Slack integration is especially cool for your team, as all events from projects and tasks are displayed in Slack. Teamwork has never been more transparent!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your team doesn't work with Slack? We are currently developing the same kind of integration for Microsoft Teams. Take a look at <a href=""https://www.awork.io/roadmap/"">our roadmap</a>, where you can find all planned awork features.</p>

19010,"Schedule Tasks in awork - How to Use Task Lists for Your Project","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""http://awork.io/produkt"">awork's </a>project and task concept is based on our years of experience in project management (500+ projects) and productivity tool development (10,000+ active users). We asked ourselves what a tool would have to look like that would allow us to perfectly organize each of our diverse projects - and then we simply implemented the answer. In this article, we give a little insight into the system of project planning with awork. How do task lists work in awork? And how do I use them correctly?</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Structuring the workload of a project is an essential part of project work or project planning. Structuring and planning the upcoming tasks has three main goals:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><li>To break down the workload for the project goal into individual tasks, making the actual work steps clear.</li><li>To be able to monitor progress throughout the duration of the project in order to manage it accordingly.</li><li>Make transparent to everyone involved about their current and upcoming tasks..</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whether you work with agile techniques, classic Gantt plans, or simple to-do lists, the goals remain the same.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":60} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From our own experience, we can say that not every project in a team runs or is worked on in the same way, although you have your favored approach for the majority of projects. Workflow tools that only rely on a Kanban board, pure Gantt planning tools, or ticketing systems are therefore only suitable for a part of the projects, and the rest is processed with Excel or covered by various task tools. Rarely does one have a holistic overview of all to-dos and projects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a software team with our own consulting and many customers in the agency sector, we know the issues and associated problems too well. This is exactly the reason why awork creates great flexibility with its unique list system. This allows users to structure each project according to the team's preferences - and we don't mean simply having different views for your group of tasks.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In awork, you have the possibility to create as many task lists as you like for each project. A single task can appear in several lists, which makes the whole thing so flexible. Is that it? Yes, almost. Each of these lists can be displayed by each user as they want or sorted by their desired relevance. For example, simply hide tasks that aren't interesting for me or display it as a Kanban board to better see the progress overview.</p>

<p>Project planning with awork in software development<br>In Scrum, you work in sprints and maintain a backlog. For the backlog, you simply create a list; the product owner fills it and arranges all tasks/stories according to priority. When a sprint begins, the Scrum Team or the Scrum Master creates another list with the sprint identifier. The sprint is then filled with the backlog stories according to the priority, and the tasks are then moved to the sprint list. The sprint list can also be displayed as a board for a better overview for the Scrum Team and the Scrum Master. If a sprint is completed, <a href=""http://awork.io/produkt"">awork</a> automatically hides the list with the old sprint and creates a new sprint list.</p>

<p>One does not always follow the classical approach in Scrum. Often seen and very popular is, for example, the division of the backlog into product features and technology topics. Here you can also maintain two backlog lists. Bug or feedback lists are also appropriate here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In our own process, we also often bundle features into smaller releases that sometimes span multiple sprints. Just create a list with the release name, add stories to the list (without moving them), and voilà, you have the perfect overview of the release progress - next to the actual sprint boards.</p>

<h3>Task lists in awork for product road mapping</h3>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Product road mapping is an activity that involves collecting, evaluating, and structuring ideas or concrete plans. Every product manager has their own ideas about how this can be done most effectively for their own products. With the lists in awork, almost every preference can be mapped cleanly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A simple possibility is, for example, the maintenance of an integrated list with all scheduled projects. In addition, each of these projects can also appear in separate lists for the different product areas to keep a clear overview of the topics in the individual areas.</p>

<p>An idea list is usually filled from various sources, such as customer inquiries, surveys, ideas from your own ranks, etc. Once these have been screened, they can either be added to the roadmap or sorted out with an appropriate task status.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A list can also represent each release by assigning the tasks to it</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tip: Through a simple <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/neues-feature/werde-noch-produktiver-verbinde-awork-mit-zapier/"">Zapier integration</a> from a customer feedback portal, such as Zendesk, new customer ideas can be automatically transferred to the roadmap idea pool. </p>

<p>In the agency sector, it is common to structure the job into individual deliverables (e.g., texts, graphics, product visualizations, etc.), as these are often billed separately. For each deliverable, you can create a list in awork and thus create clear divides of the job into individual areas. In addition, a list of overhead activities is often useful for the project manager. In this list, you can plan or record customer contacts, invoicing, preliminary talks, inquiries, etc.</p>

<p>With the <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/neues-feature/noch-produktiver-mit-unteraufgaben-in-aufgaben/"">subtasks in awork</a>, you can plan your tasks even better. For example, a to-do can consist of several subtasks. Instead of creating a new task in awork for each to-do, you can insert subtasks into the respective task. For example, in a design project, you can break down the design of new Facebook ads into the steps of brainstorming, copywriting, design, and management in the Facebook Ads Manager. Subtasks aren't just super great for keeping track of task progress. They're also handy when you're working with multiple people on a to-do. In our particular example, a designer, a copywriter, and a marketing manager would be involved in the task.</p>

<p>Like in a ticketing system, the first intention would be to easily throw every activity into a big task list, e.g., fill a big list with all topics and create a list ""this week"". Urgent topics can be moved to this task list and assigned to the appropriate people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Tip from us: Leave out the big list of all collected tasks and divide all topics into three lists: Prio High, Prio Medium, and Idea Pool. This makes it easier for you and your team to find tasks in your awork quickly and to keep a constant overview.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also welcome is the division into different task areas or even the combination of these with a Prio list. For example, for advertising campaigns, a division into the different products or the different marketing channels can use a task list ""this week"" or ""priority A"".</p>

<p>We just released some <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/neues-feature/neue-funktionen-september/"">long-awaited features for productive teams in September</a>, and now you can already look forward to more updates in awork. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves, so you can find all the details about the new features in this blog post.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From now on, there is a brand new section in the awork menu: Teams. Here you can assign single or multiple teams to each user.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This allows you to group projects and users of your workspace and limit their visibility to other teams. This makes the option possible that teams can only see their own projects, but not other teams' projects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, imagine you're working on a new project for a large company that only a few employees are privy to for now. In this case, you can use the Teams feature. Only the project team can access the respective projects, tasks, and information.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to users, you can also assign entire projects to specific teams. If you want to add new users to your workspace, you can already select a team at this point.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Note: As long as you haven't created any teams, you won't see any options in your workspace to assign users or projects to teams or to filter by them.</strong></p>

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By dividing your workspace into teams, you now have new filtering options. For example, you can view the workload of individual colleagues in team planning or evaluate recorded times by the given team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can find the new function in the menu under <em>Settings</em>. Here you can also see the projects on which you are assigned to. In rights management, you can assign rights based on the team level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since there are so many cool use cases for the new Teams feature, we've put together all the info you need into a webinar on October 13, 2020 at 5pm.

<p>Until now, you could only create dependencies between tasks in the Timeline. We've simplified this workflow significantly. Now you can also create dependencies in the task details. Using the&nbsp;<em>three-dot</em>&nbsp;icon, you can select one or more tasks that need to be completed first.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last but not least, we have a small innovation in the task view. There you now can filter your tasks by individual status. Under Task Filter, you will find the new option&nbsp;<em>Contains</em>&nbsp;under&nbsp;<em>Status</em>. Until now, you could only choose between our predefined statuses. We have changed that now.</p>

<h2>Copy-and-paste of files and clearer management of your uploads</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's super handy to be able to attach files directly to their associated tasks in awork. But sometimes, you're looking for a particular file, or you just want to attach it to the project, not to a specific task. To make this possible, we have taken file management in awork to the next level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As of now, there is a new project tab called: Files. Here you will find an overview of all files that have been uploaded within the project. This also means those that were added via the comments. You can preview, download, or delete files in the file overview.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can sort the files by task, user, and file type or just leave them unsorted. The files appear unsorted in the order in which they were uploaded. Of course, we have also set up a search function, with which you can search for a specific file.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Handy tip: You can now easily paste files into comments using the copy-and-paste shortcut.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The task lists are now displayed larger, so even longer titles are easy to read on the big screen.</li><li>The list view also shows you more content on the big screen, such as your planned effort, the number of completed subtasks, your recorded time, the editor, and of course, the deadline.</li><li>In the project view, you can also see directly on the big screen the number of tasks that are in progress.</li><li>The assigned person of a task is now also permanently visible on the big screen and not only when hovering.</li></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For an even better overview on the large screen, especially in projects with many lists and numerous tasks, we have also added a minimap as a navigation aid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As soon as you use awork on a large screen or in a large window, the minimap appears on the right side of the screen. The minimap is an overview of your task lists and shows the task status or changes in the project. Of course, with your large screen, you can also use the minimap for navigation and jump to a specific location in your task lists.</p>

<h2>Enhancements in the time tracking settings</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes you forget to record the working time and have to estimate it afterward. In some jobs, this is not a big problem, but in others, it is. Especially when this working time is billed to a customer, accurate time tracking is important.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From now on, you have the possibility to define if your team is allowed to record times on tasks after they have been completed. You can also specify until when exactly past times can be added to a task.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To do this, click on <em>Settings</em> in the awork menu and then on <em>Workspace</em>. You can define if you want to prevent time tracking on completed projects and how many days in retrospect time tracking is possible.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>awork is made for working in teams - we want to support you in achieving more with your team and making ambitious goals a reality. With the Baboon release, we have dedicated ourselves to features that make your teamwork in awork even easier.</p>

<p>The Baboon update adds a completely new column to your project details: the project budget.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Via the project budget, you can define the number of working hours that are available for a project. For example, if your team is managing a client project for which two weeks of work time has been agreed upon, you can now enter this time budget in the project details. As the project progresses, you can track how much time has been spent or is still open.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The project budget, like all time details in awork, is very easy to enter. For example, for a project duration of two weeks, you enter 14d.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a project manager, it can happen that you are in charge of more than ten projects at the same time and have to keep an eye on them. Clarity is then the be-all and end-all. That's why you can group projects in your project overview with awork Baboon. For example, you can display your projects sorted by month, status, customer, or many other options.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Imagine that at the beginning of the year, you already have 12 customer projects that need to be handled in parallel. With the new function, you could display these projects grouped by month. This way, you can see at a glance which projects are due next.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://support.awork.io/hc/de/articles/360002815040-Zeitauswertungen"">new time evaluation</a> in awork has numerous filter options. For example, you can filter a new evaluation by period, user, project, task type, day, or&nbsp;<em>even non-billable or billable.</em>&nbsp;Groupings are also possible to change the presentation of the evaluation. So what does this look like?</p>

<p>Imagine you work together with your support team in an IT system house for various customers. In your customer projects, you work with tickets. Each ticket represents a technical problem that needs to be solved for the customer. At the end of the month, your customer wants to know how much working time you have spent on supporting and solving the various problems.</p>

<p>Another possibility: You work in an agency that charges by the job. For example, an hour of strategy is more expensive than copywriting, or an hour of work by a senior manager is charged much more than an hour of work by a junior PR manager.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the new time evaluation in awork, these forms of billing can also be taken into account in time evaluation.

19158,"Five Project Management Mistakes Still Being Made By Creative Teams","<!-- wp:paragraph {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<p class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong>What eats up the most time in many marketing departments? Bad project management. Here we'll show you some of the biggest and most common mistakes:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You've probably all experienced this in your working life: information disappears into Excel spreadsheets, no one knows who's working on which project at any given time, and the tasks for the next few weeks aren't evident either. Many marketing teams and agencies are still stuck in a time when Microsoft Office skills were important on a resume, and emails were the universal communication tool. Today, we'll show you the five project management mistakes that still happen and how to avoid them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why is it so important to build project management on a solid foundation? Because work is much more fun when you can concentrate on your actual tasks - and don't have to check data in Excel spreadsheets. So it's better to introduce a modern tool to take care of the annoying topic of project management in a relaxed way. Unfortunately, not every company is ready for this quite yet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, let's take a look at typical scenarios that symbolically show what still goes wrong in so many teams:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":60} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Scenario 1: Team planning with Excel</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A normal approach in many teams: Project managers often start with smaller units of two people and first create an Excel spreadsheet with projects and customers. As the team and the company grow, the file quickly expands into an XXL planning spreadsheet - in which the maintenance eats up an incredible amount of time. Whole workdays are spent on keeping boxes with responsibilities, deadlines, and partners up to date. The second problem is that nothing works without the project managers. They are the only ones with an overview, and it is only their time commitment that keeps the whole thing together. The moral: In today's world, an accessible central tool is needed for project management.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":60} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Scenario 2: Multi-tools for time tracking</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyone starting in a new job today is usually confronted with countless tools in use (if the company has moved beyond the Excel strategy). What happens most often, especially in agencies, is that a project management tool is in use, where tasks are also tracked from time to time. However, time recording usually takes place with another software solution. The consequence: In order to be able to invoice or control projects from the times, these times are exported manually and imported again into another tool - with a lot of Excel magic in between. The moral: Constantly moving data back and forth is no fun and can lead to mistakes. It's better to use a tool that can handle all your requirements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":60} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Scenario 3: Sticky notes and email inbox</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be honest. You, too, sometimes organize yourself using two crucial tools: Email inbox + calendar. I'm sure some of you also stick Post-Its with your to-do's on the monitor. This works well, at least as long as tasks are related only to your own small world. But as soon as you have to work with other people, things start to go downhill. Emails are overlooked, assignments are wrongly assigned, etc. And at some point, everyone is pissed off because no one knows who is really doing which task. The moral: You need a central place where everyone can see and manage their pending tasks transparently. This allows you to finally also understand what the others are working on.</p>

<h2>Scenario 4: Practice GDPR</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once a department has decided to introduce a new tool, it is not only the ""training"" of all employees that is a problem. Often, free software is used first; projects are created, accounts are set up. But then there can quickly be trouble: The trial period expires, and money is due after all. The purchasing department refuses. But not because the tool is too expensive, but because the data protection department notices that all data is stored in the USA. The moral: It is better to use GDPR-compliant tools right from the start.</p>

<h2>Scenario 5: Stuck in old ways</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":20} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's take another step back: the introduction of new tools often fails due to the stubbornness of individual team members. Who wants to go to the trouble of learning new software when it has worked the same way for 20 years? So, for the time being, everyone continues as before. And the chaos is pre-programmed. The moral: Look for software that is easy to use and understandable for everyone in the team without any problems.</p>

<p>Again and again we’ve been asked if there is a place for another software-tool in the highly competitive market for team organisation. Of course there is! In all respects: An overwhelming number of companies still work manually, cumbersomely and without up-to-date tools for work management - and this at a time when we are all geographically separated and depend on good coordination. Silicon Valley has indeed produced some good tools. But most are generic and too complex to be used as the basis of work organization for our target groups. It's time we found a European answer to organizing work. Beautifully designed and thought through, simple, intuitive, reliable and secure.</p>

<p>Our rapid journey over the last few months shows just how well this works: already, many thousands of users are organizing their everyday work with awork. Among them are such diverse teams as the international agency group thjnk, the Hamburg-based NGO Viva con Agua, the traditional corporation Henkel Beauty Care and the city administration of Wiesbaden. Der Spiegel mentioned us, Die Welt reported about us, we were in Gründerszene, Handelsblatt and on TV (really ☺️). Based on our role models, creative teams, we’ continue to develop awork into an indispensable organizational helper for more and more companies.</p>

<p>Our roadmap does everything we can to keep awork simple while providing a complete organizing process for teams that is a joy to work with. Some of the upcoming focus topics:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our funding would have been even easier if we got a euro for every customer*s question ""Is there a calendar integration for tasks?"" 😉 And as (almost) always, our users are absolutely right. Tools for creating project plans abound. Todo lists are also a dime a dozen. And calendar apps even more so. But there is still no usable integration between project and task planning (over days, weeks, months with milestones and many participants) and the personal weekly calendar of individual team members. We are therefore currently paying special attention to this central step in the organization of work - and will be doing so over the coming months, with several releases and features in this area to follow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":30} -->
<div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Small teams (up to 5 users) and very large teams (up to 5,000 users) work with awork. To ensure that both ends of the spectrum can work with a well-maintained, simple solution, our Team will work hard to build out the necessary complexity for our enterprise customers while keeping our smaller premium teams out of it.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to major extensions, several thousand improvements and optimizations have accumulated in our product roadmap over the last few months. Maturing awork as a product is not just about the milestones and big feature launches, but about continuously improving all processes and their user experience. We see this as another essential building block for the coming period.</p>

<p>We spend a lot of our time working. So it should go without saying that we are happy with and at our work. At awork we believe that we can contribute our part to this.

<p>Nils, Lucas and I are absolutely convinced that, with awork, we are in the right place at the right time. Following the sale of our company HQLabs, we have therefore just invested three million euros in our team and our product at the turn of the year. So after 10 years as a founding-team and running a company, we are starting out together once again. This time with a few gray hairs, a lot of experience with B2B SaaS and a team that is second to none.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, awork is available in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Belgium. In the coming months, the rest of Europe will follow, with Scandinavia leading the way. To make this happen, we have gathered a great team around us. A management team with whom we already have many years of shared experience, friendship and mutual trust in our abilities. Together we are now looking for more people to join us in all areas: Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Support, HR... to be a team of 35 people again by mid 2022.</p>

<p>Again and again we’ve been asked if there is a place for another software-tool in the highly competitive market for team organisation. Of course there is! In all respects: An overwhelming number of companies still work manually, cumbersomely and without up-to-date tools for work management - and this at a time when we are all geographically separated and depend on good coordination. Silicon Valley has indeed produced some good tools. But most are generic and too complex to be used as the basis of work organization for our target groups. It's time we found a European answer to organizing work. Beautifully designed and thought through, simple, intuitive, reliable and secure.</p>

<p>Our rapid journey over the last few months shows just how well this works: already, many thousands of users are organizing their everyday work with awork. Among them are such diverse teams as the international agency group thjnk, the Hamburg-based NGO Viva con Agua, the traditional corporation Henkel Beauty Care and the city administration of Wiesbaden. Der Spiegel mentioned us, Die Welt reported about us, we were in Gründerszene, Handelsblatt and on TV (really :-). Based on our role models, creative teams, we’ continue to develop awork into an indispensable organizational helper for more and more companies.</p>

<p>Our funding would have been even easier if we got a euro for every customer*s question ""Is there a calendar integration for tasks?"" 😉 And as (almost) always, our users are absolutely right. Tools for creating project plans abound. Todo lists are also a dime a dozen. And calendar apps even more so. But there is still no usable integration between project and task planning (over days, weeks, months with milestones and many participants) and the personal weekly calendar of individual team members. We are therefore currently paying special attention to this central step in the organization of work - and will be doing so over the coming months, with several releases and features in this area to follow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""20px""} -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Small teams (up to 5 users) and very large teams (up to 5,000 users) work with awork. To ensure that both ends of the spectrum can work with a well-maintained, simple solution, our Team will work hard to build out the necessary complexity for our enterprise customers while keeping our smaller premium teams out of it.</p>

<p>In addition to major extensions, several thousand improvements and optimizations have accumulated in our product roadmap over the last few months. Maturing awork as a product is not just about the milestones and big feature launches, but about continuously improving all processes and their user experience. We see this as another essential building block for the coming period.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But let's start from the beginning: There are many tools out there for scheduling work in topics and projects. There are also some that organize your own calendar. But so far, no tool has managed to break down project and resource planning all the way down to the personal calendar appointment. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So we thought: Challenge accepted. 💪</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>From a rough idea through dozens of sketches, prototypes, interviews, user tests, and with a little bit of magic, we created <strong>the most intensely conceptualized and lovingly implemented feature</strong> we've ever launched.</p>

<h3><strong>Case 1: Finding out if there is still capacity for a project</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your team has won a big pitch (yay) and as the team lead you now want to schedule a project for the new client. You know your rough time budget, so the approximate project duration and deadline. But how do you quickly find out if you currently have enough capacity for the new project?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The solution: </strong>A glance at the <a href=""https://support.awork.io/en/articles/6109214-the-workload-overview"">workload overview</a> shows you immediately how busy your team will be in the near future, who is currently working on which projects and people are on vacation. By hovering, you can see the distribution of the workload, e.g. to find out why someone is overbooked, and can estimate whether there is still capacity for another project.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If there are enough resources available, you schedule the new project with a rough time budget. Et voilà, the project team's capacity is immediately blocked and included in the workload.</p>

<h3><strong>Case 2: The endless planning and capacity meeting</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You are a project manager and coordinate several projects at the same time. Therefore, you need a weekly overview of all active projects, you have to keep an eye on deadlines and distribute tasks fairly within the team. How do you best decide who should take care of which to-do?</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The solution: </strong>Take a look at the timeline view together with your team. Extend tasks that are dragging on, grab unscheduled tasks and distribute them across the team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a click on the workload view, you can check who is super busy this week and who still got some space. Even <a href=""https://support.awork.io/en/articles/6131248-absences"">absences</a> on short notice such as sick leave are visible so you can reschedule and redistribute tasks if necessary.</p>

<h3><strong>Case 3: Schedule urgent to-dos that need to be done IMMEDIATELY</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The classic: On a Thursday morning, a high-pro customer has a bunch of small but veeery urgent to-dos for you, which have to be done by the end of the week. As the team lead, you have to figure out how to get them done quickly and who in the team can take care of them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    },
    ""align"": """",
    ""mode"": ""preview""
} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The solution: </strong>Keep calm and use the calendar view. Simply filter the list of unplanned tasks by due date to get an overview of the most urgent to-dos. In the calendar you can see exactly what your team members have on the table in the next few days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your colleague still has a few hours to spare this afternoon? Nice, just drag and drop the urgent task into his calendar to block time for it. With one click, you can check in the workload view that no one is overbooked - despite tight deadlines.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3><strong>Case 4: The daily struggle with your exploding calendar</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a creative, you're probably familiar with this: On Monday, a mountain of new to-dos piles up on your desk. You have to find a way to fit them into your weekly schedule alongside client calls, team meetings, and so on.</p>

<p><strong>The solution: </strong>From now on, you can organize your workday in the calendar view. Appointments, such as team weekly meetings or customer calls, are visible there - so you know exactly when you have time for project tasks. Simply drag and drop them from the to-do list to the free space in your calendar.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Surprise, surprise! Although the release of our <a href=""https://www.awork.io/en/blog/out-now-the-new-planner💜/"">awesome planner</a> is just two weeks ago, we already have the next update for you. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Often it's the small features and functions that make a product so great - and in this release <strong>(codename hamster 🐹)</strong> we have a lot of them for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have not only put a lot of expert knowledge and a large portion of joy in the development of the long-awaited features, but also included lots of your feedback (at this point a big thank you for that!).</p>

<h2><strong>Self orga like a pro: Private projects</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Only if your self orga is right, you will master a happy collaboration in your team. Many of you have wished for a way to organize yourself even better in awork. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With this release we have created exactly this space (*drum roll*): Private projects. Here you can <strong>organize your personal to-dos</strong> – without team members being able to see them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Private projects work the same way as you know it from your team projects. In the project overview they are marked with a lock icon. Here you can also create filters to show only private or only public projects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you create a new project, you can directly select whether it is private or not. Even in your existing projects you can easily switch to private via the edit mode. Of course, <strong>multiple team members can work on a private project</strong>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you assign a task from a private project to a person who is not working on it, then this person will see the task - but will not have access to the project. Smart!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<div style=""height:40px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, there is no <em>times</em> tab in private projects as you know it from public projects. If you set an existing project to private, you must either delete already tracked times (this is queried directly during the changeover) or you transfer all times to another project in advance via multi-select.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You probably know this: Besides your project to-dos, there are many other tasks you absolutely have to do: gather feedback for a colleague, prepare workshops, create the new office playlist, etc. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How cool would it be to organize all that in a private space? Just create a private project and plan your projects in the usual lists, kanban boards and timeline - privately, without your colleagues looking over your shoulder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You want to plan your next release party, but don't want your team to know about the cool party games and the secret champagne order yet? To keep your project a surprise, you can create a private project and prepare all the party to-dos in it.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Automations are smart, time-saving and therefore super nice! They relieve you of recurring to-dos in your daily project routine and make sure you have more time for more important things. They consist of a trigger, which initiates a subsequent action. Until now, you could only choose triggers and actions at the task level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Good news: From now on, you can apply automations not only to tasks, but also to the project level! 😍</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The new project automations trigger special actions when a change occurs in the project. Sounds very abstract at first, but it's quite simple. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, you can set your project to be automatically set to <em>Done</em> when all tasks are done – nice! The new triggers and actions on the project level can be found as usual under <em>Automation</em> in your project settings.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a team lead, you need to keep track of all project deadlines. Constantly checking the project overview to see when your projects are due can be a real pain. From now on, there's an easier way: a smart automation that notifies you in time to keeps you stress free:</p>

<p>After the project is before the project. It's easy to forget to inform the accounting department that a project is finished and that the tracked times can be billed to the customer.

<p>So that you can use them even better, there are now these small but nice innovations:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>You can now duplicate existing project templates.</li><li>Existing projects can now be converted into a template.</li><li>There is now a search function when adding templates to help you find the template you want to use for your project faster.</li></ul>

<p>You put a lot of effort into setting up a great project for the last campaign, creating lots of lists, defining specific task statuses, and so on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How nice would it be if you could just use this project again for the next campaign? No problemo! From now on you can easily convert any existing project into a template. Just click on the three-dot icon and choose <em>Create Template</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You decide which parts of the project should be saved in this template – for example automations, project settings, task lists or the status of tasks and projects.</p>

<p>Last but not least: The ""blue task status"". When a task was in to-do status, it was indicated by a gray circle in the list view. In the kanban board, however, the status icon was blue – you wished for a consistent solution.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aaand done: From now on <strong>you have the choice how the to-do status is displayed</strong>, uniformly in all views.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When creating a new to-do status in the project settings, simply use the switch to select whether the coloured icon should be used or not. If you use different ""blue"" statuses, you can now distinguish them in the list view. Nicenstein!</p>

<p>In addition to these features, we have made some small improvements, for example implementing a new more reliable solution for previewing Microsoft Office files and the prevention of task jumping between lists. We've also further optimized the planner, including making overbookings even better highlighted in color so they are immediately visible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the next months, <strong>the awork roadmap is packed </strong>with many small enhancements and updates - and of course there are also some overarching big topics are on the agenda.&nbsp;As always, we'll keep you up posted. 💜</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Good news for all those who enter their tasks in the calendar of <a href=""https://www.awork.io/en/blog/out-now-the-new-planner💜"">the new planner</a>: We have extended the calendar integration.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So far, appointments from your calendar were displayed in awork and included in the <a href=""http://support.awork.io/en/articles/6131253-the-workload-calculation"">workload calculation</a>. From now on, the tasks you schedule in the planner's calendar will also be synced back into your Google or Microsoft calendar. 🤩</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To do this, awork creates an additional calendar in your Google or Microsoft calendar that you can display, hide or share with others. This way, your <strong>scheduled tasks are directly visible on your smartphone or computer</strong>. Super cool for those who only work with the calendar and have tasks assigned to them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can find out how to activate the calendar sync for tasks in the planner <a href=""https://support.awork.io/en/articles/6131262-calendar-integration"">in this helpcenter article</a>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With this, you can now plan your working day even smoother. By making your awork tasks visible in your calendar, everyone can see that you don't have time for meetings during the periods blocked by awork. This way, you <strong>avoid project work colliding with your appointments</strong> and can work in a more focused way. Nice!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Attention: <strong>This is a one-way sync</strong>. This means that if you change or delete the awork appointments in your calendar, they will not be synced back to awork. It can therefore happen that your changes in the calendar appointment are overwritten when the task is updated in the awork planner. To avoid this, you will find a link in each awork appointment that will take you directly to the respective task in the planner where you can make your changes.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In total, there are four new templates that we have thoughtfully created for you. They include project and task statuses, task lists, automations and many tips on how to get the most out of the template and workflow.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The templates are not set in stone, of course. Once you've created a project from a template, you can <strong>customize all the settings</strong> to suit your needs. And from your customized project, you can now simply save your own template. Super handy!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""https://support.awork.io/en/articles/6298375-pre-built-project-templates-by-awork"">Here</a> you can find all the details about the new templates by awork.</p>

<p>A small but nice innovation: So far, you could only create <a href=""https://support.awork.io/en/articles/5371609-project-timeline"">dependencies between tasks in the timeline</a> of your projects. In the templates, task dependencies were missing – until now. We have changed that with this update.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In both project and task templates, you can now define <strong>dependencies that will automatically end up in your project when the template is used</strong>. This way, you can pre-define strict workflows and handy hints and provide your team with complete, pre-defined project plans that can be loaded with one click.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A new feature that many of you will be happy about: We rebuilt the tags window into a tags pop-up to maintain consistency with similar elements and made some cool improvements while we were at it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From now on, the pop-up at the top shows the tags you used last. Directly below, you will see all tags that exist in the current project - sorted by the most frequently used. Via the tag search, you still have access to all tags that exist in your workspace.</p>

<p>The creation of a project plan is one of the most <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/lesenswert/projektmanagement-methoden/"">important methods of project management</a>.

<p>Although the term project plan is widely used, it is not clearly defined. The project plan is created and continuously updated by the project manager or at the beginning of the process. This maintenance is one of the most crucial project management tasks and takes a significant part of the working time, especially in larger projects. Depending on how extensive the project is, this plan can be more or less detailed. The crucial thing is a clear and understandable structure, especially for complex projects.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The work breakdown structure (WBS) contains the complete representation of all components of a project. For this purpose, the project is broken down hierarchically into subprojects and tasks. The work breakdown structure also shows the relationships between different project elements, but not the time sequence. The term work breakdown structure (WBS) already contains the principle of dividing components of the project. In terms of its graphic structure, the work breakdown structure is usually reminiscent of an organization chart, which shows the hierarchy of tasks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you supplement this plan with a time axis, we speak of a project execution plan. This also contains defined dates for the start and end of the project. The project schedule can also be supplemented with milestones that represent particularly important events or deadlines in the course of the project.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The project schedule is graphically similar to a calendar or a timeline. It gives you an overview of all deadlines in the entire project.</p>

<p>The best method to creating your project plan is to proceed step by step. A helpful approach is to focus on the question words, which you probably already know <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/userstory/als-projektmanager-mit-awork-den-ueberblick-behalten/"">from project management</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3><em><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Where</span> are we in the project?</strong></em></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's start by looking at the initial situation of your project. Have you planned and executed similar projects in the past? Finding out which basics and prerequisites you will need to work on your project should always be the first step in creating your further planning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Check whether you can adopt certain elements, processes, or templates. What information is already available and what is still missing to start implementing the project?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3><em><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Why</span> should this project be carried out?</strong></em></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This question is very important and yet often neglected. What (economic) benefits do you expect from this project? When is the investment worthwhile (return on investment)? What opportunities does this project offer? In a typical project clarification, one also speaks of the expected success outlook towards which one is working.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By answering these questions, you can prevent pointless projects from being initiated. On the other hand, if the benefit is clear, this consideration will help you to inspire others for your project, even in difficult phases.</p>

<h3><em>&nbsp;<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What</span> do we want to achieve in this project?</strong></em></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To avoid misunderstandings and conflicts, everyone involved must know what the project goal is. The clearer and more measurable, the better! Try to formulate your goals according to the S.M.A.R.T principle. Unlike the success outlook, the project goal should describe very specifically what will be created, produced, or delivered directly as part of the work - not what it is intended to achieve in the long term.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In turn, it should also be clear what goals are not being pursued by the project. If this question has been considered and answered in-depth, it is much easier to follow up during project management if difficulties arise.</p>

<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Who</span> <em><strong>is involved in this project?</strong></em></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At this point in the creation of the project plan, you work out who is associated with this project. Who are the people involved in the project, and what roles should each team member play? It's not just about the direct project team, but also other parties involved, called stakeholders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here you should also check whether there are other interested or affected parties and how they can be taken into account. You should also define rules for cooperation within the team. For example, is there regular coordination in the form of a weekly or monthly catch-up?</p>

<h3><em><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">How</span> will this project be structured?</strong></em></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, you should not neglect the last question for the creation of your project plan. This is about resources and how much they may cost. Calculate how much effort will be required for the individual work packages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How should the budget be divided, and what are the total costs? The project costs are often already specified by the client, resulting in the (internal) cost planning.</p>

<h3><em><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">By when</span> should the project goal be achieved?</strong></em></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Often, a client will give you a deadline for the project, but you should set the deadline yourself for internal projects. In addition, you can divide the project into different time stages and milestones at this point. For example, determine when important sub-goals should be achieved.</p>

<p>That's all for the content and basis of a project plan; now it's time for the structure! The main characteristic of the structure is that all elements are structured hierarchically. A project consists of subprojects, which in turn consist of work packages, which are composed of subtasks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you have created a suitable plan, you can use it as a project plan template. Such templates facilitate the start of all further projects enormously, and many tools offer corresponding functions.</p>

<p>Let's stay with the project plan example, Organize Team Event. While you've only shown the structure of the existing elements of the project plan so far, what's missing now is a time-based classification. Otherwise, there is a high risk of the event falling through due to a lack of lead time. So you always need to make sure you have a project schedule (see above).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A particularly widespread way of presenting a schedule is as a so-called Gantt chart. This was developed at the beginning of the last century by <a href=""https://www.gantt.com/"">Henry Gantt</a>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a Gantt chart, the duration of the individual work packages is represented as bars. The arrangement of these bars on a horizontal time axis defines the beginning and the end of a task.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Especially in comparison to a classic calendar representation, the Gantt chart has the advantage that it can represent hierarchies and dependencies, making it much better for tasks that run over a long period of time.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, create a work breakdown structure by entering all components of your project in awork. It is best to proceed hierarchically. Second, make a list for each subproject in your awork project. Then add the corresponding tasks to this list, for which you can define subtasks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To create a project schedule, switch from the list view to <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/neues-feature/visuelle-planung/"">the timeline view</a>. This shows all the tasks of your project over time - like a Gantt chart, only better.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Especially handy: To avoid your planning becoming unnecessarily long, you can display several tasks in one line in awork. This is one of the main differences between the timeline in awork and a generic Gantt chart, where there is only room for one task per line.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now define dependencies between the tasks so that it is clear which things are to be worked on first. Finally, you can add important milestones by clicking on the respective date. Planning projects has never been easier!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As soon as you start working on your project tasks, they change color in the timeline, so you can always see the current status. In addition, it is always clear who is currently working on a topic - the user's face is displayed directly in the task.</p>

<p>At first glance, it may seem very complex to create a project plan. However, this plan will save you a lot of time and hassle in project management. So make sure to keep the plan up to date as you go along!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take your time to answer the 7 question words (Who? What? Where? When? Why? How? And how much?). Don't forget to write down all project elements in a structured and complete way, preferably in a <a href=""https://app.awork.io/signup"">project management tool</a>, and last but not least, integrate a timeline and define the milestones.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The home remedy of the Excel spreadsheet should be avoided at all costs. Updating a ""hand-made"" project plan is no fun, error-prone, and unnecessarily time-consuming. Instead, let a <a href=""https://app.awork.io/signup"">clever software</a> like awork support you, and nothing will stand in the way of your successful project!</p>

<h3><strong>What is a project plan?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A project plan bundles all plans and tasks that are important for the successful execution of a project. A work breakdown structure (WBS) is the complete representation of all project elements, and their relationships is called a work breakdown structure (WBS). A project execution<strong> </strong>additionally contains the time schedule.</p>

<h3><strong><strong>How is a project plan structured?</strong></strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A project plan contains all components of the project. Usually, a project consists of subprojects, which in turn consist of work packages composed of subtasks. The individual elements are structured hierarchically in the project plan to create a kind of tree structure.</p>

<h3><strong><strong>Why is a project plan useful?</strong></strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The project plan significantly reduces the complexity of your project. It presents all components of a project clearly and thus creates a clear and understandable structure. This saves a lot of time and trouble in project management.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Write down all project elements in a structured and complete manner. It is best to proceed hierarchically and orient yourself on the 7-W questions (Where? Why? What? Who? How? Until when? How much?). Once you have presented all project components, you can integrate a timeline and define milestones.</p>

<p>Although the term project plan is widely used, it is not clearly defined. The project plan is created and continuously updated by the project manager or at the beginning of the process. This maintenance is one of the most crucial project management tasks and takes a significant part of the working time, especially in larger projects. Depending on how extensive the project is, this plan can be more or less detailed. The crucial thing is a clear and understandable structure, especially for complex projects.</p>

<p>The work breakdown structure (WBS) contains the complete representation of all components of a project. For this purpose, the project is broken down hierarchically into subprojects and tasks. The work breakdown structure also shows the relationships between different project elements, but not the time sequence. The term work breakdown structure (WBS) already contains the principle of dividing components of the project. In terms of its graphic structure, the work breakdown structure is usually reminiscent of an organization chart, which shows the hierarchy of tasks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you supplement this plan with a time axis, we speak of a project execution plan. This also contains defined dates for the start and end of the project. The project schedule can also be supplemented with milestones that represent particularly important events or deadlines in the course of the project.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The project schedule is graphically similar to a calendar or a timeline. It gives you an overview of all deadlines in the entire project.</p>

<h3><em><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Where</span> are we in the project?</strong></em></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's start by looking at the initial situation of your project. Have you planned and executed similar projects in the past? Finding out which basics and prerequisites you will need to work on your project should always be the first step in creating your further planning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Check whether you can adopt certain elements, processes, or templates. What information is already available and what is still missing to start implementing the project?</p>

<h3><em><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Why</span> should this project be carried out?</strong></em></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This question is very important and yet often neglected. What (economic) benefits do you expect from this project? When is the investment worthwhile (return on investment)? What opportunities does this project offer? In a typical project clarification, one also speaks of the expected success outlook towards which one is working.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By answering these questions, you can prevent pointless projects from being initiated. On the other hand, if the benefit is clear, this consideration will help you to inspire others for your project, even in difficult phases.</p>

<h3><em>&nbsp;<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What</span> do we want to achieve in this project?</strong></em></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To avoid misunderstandings and conflicts, everyone involved must know what the project goal is. The clearer and more measurable, the better! Try to formulate your goals according to the S.M.A.R.T principle. Unlike the success outlook, the project goal should describe very specifically what will be created, produced, or delivered directly as part of the work - not what it is intended to achieve in the long term.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In turn, it should also be clear what goals are not being pursued by the project. If this question has been considered and answered in-depth, it is much easier to follow up during project management if difficulties arise.</p>

<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Who</span> <em><strong>is involved in this project?</strong></em></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At this point in the creation of the project plan, you work out who is associated with this project. Who are the people involved in the project, and what roles should each team member play? It's not just about the direct project team, but also other parties involved, called stakeholders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here you should also check whether there are other interested or affected parties and how they can be taken into account. You should also define rules for cooperation within the team. For example, is there regular coordination in the form of a weekly or monthly catch-up?</p>

<p>Of course, you should not neglect the last question for the creation of your project plan. This is about resources and how much they may cost. Calculate how much effort will be required for the individual work packages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How should the budget be divided, and what are the total costs? The project costs are often already specified by the client, resulting in the (internal) cost planning.</p>

<p>Let's stay with the project plan example, Organize Team Event. While you've only shown the structure of the existing elements of the project plan so far, what's missing now is a time-based classification. Otherwise, there is a high risk of the event falling through due to a lack of lead time. So you always need to make sure you have a project schedule (see above).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A particularly widespread way of presenting a schedule is as a so-called Gantt chart. This was developed at the beginning of the last century by <a href=""https://www.gantt.com/"">Henry Gantt</a>.</p>

<p>In a Gantt chart, the duration of the individual work packages is represented as bars. The arrangement of these bars on a horizontal time axis defines the beginning and the end of a task.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Especially in comparison to a classic calendar representation, the Gantt chart has the advantage that it can represent hierarchies and dependencies, making it much better for tasks that run over a long period of time.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, create a work breakdown structure by entering all components of your project in awork. It is best to proceed hierarchically. Second, make a list for each subproject in your awork project. Then add the corresponding tasks to this list, for which you can define subtasks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To create a project schedule, switch from the list view to <a href=""https://blog.awork.io/neues-feature/visuelle-planung/"">the timeline view</a>. This shows all the tasks of your project over time - like a Gantt chart, only better.</p>

<p>Tasks for which you have already set a start and end date are automatically displayed in the timeline. Unscheduled tasks can be dragged and dropped from the list on the right side of the screen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Especially handy: To avoid your planning becoming unnecessarily long, you can display several tasks in one line in awork. This is one of the main differences between the timeline in awork and a generic Gantt chart, where there is only room for one task per line.</p>

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":60} -->

<p>Now define dependencies between the tasks so that it is clear which things are to be worked on first. Finally, you can add important milestones by clicking on the respective date. Planning projects has never been easier!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As soon as you start working on your project tasks, they change color in the timeline, so you can always see the current status. In addition, it is always clear who is currently working on a topic - the user's face is displayed directly in the task.</p>

<p>At first glance, it may seem very complex to create a project plan. However, this plan will save you a lot of time and hassle in project management. So make sure to keep the plan up to date as you go along!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take your time to answer the 7 question words (Who? What? Where? When? Why? How? And how much?). Don't forget to write down all project elements in a structured and complete way, preferably in a <a href=""https://app.awork.io/signup"">project management tool</a>, and last but not least, integrate a timeline and define the milestones.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The home remedy of the Excel spreadsheet should be avoided at all costs. Updating a ""hand-made"" project plan is no fun, error-prone, and unnecessarily time-consuming. Instead, let a <a href=""https://app.awork.io/signup"">clever software</a> like awork support you, and nothing will stand in the way of your successful project!</p>

<h3><strong>What is a project plan?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A project plan bundles all plans and tasks that are important for the successful execution of a project. A work breakdown structure (WBS) is the complete representation of all project elements, and their relationships is called a work breakdown structure (WBS). A project execution<strong> </strong>additionally contains the time schedule.</p>

<h3><strong><strong>How is a project plan structured?</strong></strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A project plan contains all components of the project. Usually, a project consists of subprojects, which in turn consist of work packages composed of subtasks. The individual elements are structured hierarchically in the project plan to create a kind of tree structure.</p>

<h3><strong><strong>Why is a project plan useful?</strong></strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The project plan significantly reduces the complexity of your project. It presents all components of a project clearly and thus creates a clear and understandable structure. This saves a lot of time and trouble in project management.</p>

<h3><strong><strong>How do I create a project plan?</strong></strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Write down all project elements in a structured and complete manner. It is best to proceed hierarchically and orient yourself on the 7-W questions (Where? Why? What? Who? How? Until when? How much?). Once you have presented all project components, you can integrate a timeline and define milestones.</p>

<h3><strong><strong>Which software do I use to create a project plan?</strong></strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>awork offers smart features that support you in creating your project plan. You can map all project elements in lists, tasks and subtasks and structure them hierarchically. The awork timeline is suitable for visual time planning. You can plan tasks via drag-and-drop, define dependencies and milestones.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You're probably familiar with this: A notification pops up in awork, you click on it lost in thought and skim the message. A short time later you have forgotten what was in it in the first place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From now on, there is a new unread status for new notifications, which is represented by <strong>a small blue dot</strong>. If you click on the notification, this dot disappears and it is considered read.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the notification will remain visible in the popup until you click the checkbox to make it disappear. This way you can access your notifications later and go through them comfortably. Nicenstein!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You prefer to hide your read comments directly? No problem: Simply activate the setting <em>Automatically mark notifications as read on click</em> in your user profile. This will make the read notifications <strong>disappear right after a reload</strong> and there's no need to uncheck them.</p>

<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For projects that are currently not running (anymore), there are the project statuses <em>Completed </em>and<em> Canceled</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Often projects in these statuses and their tasks still appeared in the selection lists and the search, especially when using the search functions. This bothered some users, especially in time tracking. Therefore, we have extensively <strong>improved the visibility of these projects</strong> in many places in awork.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""40px""} -->
<div style=""height:40px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What has changed?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From now on, the search results include by default all non-completed projects (for example, projects with the status In Planning, Running, etc.). If you want to explicitly <strong>include completed projects and their tasks</strong> in the searchers, you can do so using the small filter icon to the right of the search box.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:acf/caption {""id"":""block_627be815a6f30"",""name"":""acf/caption"",""data"":{""block_style"":""image_left"",""_block_style"":""field_60f95b1275292"",""margin_top"":""mt-s"",""_margin_top"":""field_60f9580be9b20"",""margin_bottom"":""mb-s"",""_margin_bottom"":""field_60f9580be9b57"",""headline"":""Decide for yourself if you want to include closed projects and their to-dos in the awork search."",""_headline"":""field_60f9580be9bca"",""text"":"""",""_text"":""field_60f958340140f"",""image"":27801,""_image"":""field_60f9584001410""},""align"":"""",""mode"":""preview""} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Completed projects are also excluded in the project selection fields. Only if you explicitly search for these projects and the switch to include completed projects is activated, they will be listed in the search results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And last but not least, a gamechanger for working with the Kanban board: You can now <strong>hide tasks in green board columns</strong> that were set to <em>Complete</em>d before today. This allows you to work with the Kanban board in a tidier way, even for long-running projects.</p>

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>awork now saves the scroll position when you jump from the overviews (e.g. project overview or task overview) to the details and then navigate back again. This makes going through many tasks or projects one after the other much more pleasant.</li><li>We have improved the text editor - for example in task and project descriptions. Selecting text and inserting styles and files now works more reliably.</li><li>We removed a slight flickering in the UI that occurred on loading screens or with logos and user* images.</li><li>The new tag popup is now also used when tagging customers and users and has received a few minor improvements.</li></ul>

<h3><strong>The problem</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At team tietge, different teams from the marketing, tech and project management departments work together. The challenge: to find a tool that is versatile and can be used across different topics. In addition, it should be flexibly adaptable to processes and preferences in order to cover the company's various workflows - and be especially suitable for the area of corporate publishing.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tools for managing projects are a dime a dozen. However, many tools that team tietge tried out were too complex. Usability suffered from the multitude of features and processes became confusing.</p>

<h3>The solution</h3>

<h3>The result</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Teamlead Christian, three aspects have improved at team tietge thanks to awork:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Significantly more employees are adopting and using the PM tool.</li><li>Despite working from home, he can reliably provide the entire team with work instructions and constantly maintains an overview of upcoming deadlines.</li><li>Performance has improved significantly and asynchronous work is now possible. Cross-departmental jobs can be implemented more easily without losing information.</li></ul>

<p>When Christian creates a project in awork, he decides between agile mode and waterfall mode depending on the project type and goals.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Team agile</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When details of the project emerge over time and there is <strong>no fixed schedule</strong>, team tietge uses agile mode. For these projects, they are guided by the working hours that are available rather than fixed deadlines. They also use this mode when managing long-term projects that run over several years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""20px""} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Team waterfall</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The waterfall mode is used by team tietge when they already know deadlines and fixed responsibilities quite well - so in this case the time factor is important to them. An example project in waterfall mode at team tietge is their project ""Hinz &amp; Kunz"". Since they need more security and a very precise overview of costs in this project, the waterfall model is suitable.</p>

<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote"" style=""font-style:italic;font-weight:500""><p>When you create a project, you can add important information for your team in the project details - for example, the project description, the editors, budget and deadline, and so on.</p></blockquote>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the start of the project, team tietge turns on the autopilot, which sends automatic mails as a reminder when, for example, deadlines are exceeded or the end of the budget is approaching. For Christian's team, the autopilot makes work much easier, because even in stressful times, nothing falls by the wayside.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you're working on multiple projects at the same time, it's a good idea to assign a combination of numbers to each project. Christian's team structures each project with a certain combination of four numbers (for example, the 5 in the combination 5485 could stand for jobs that are currently active, the 4 for an external project, etc.). team tietge can thus not only find the respective project fixed in the awork search, but also recognize references in other systems more quickly.</p>

<p>The next step: create project plans and adjust them flexibly. team tietge uses all three task views in awork: List, Kanban and Timeline. How do they go about it?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When starting a new project, the team always starts in the list view to do the rough outlining. Christian collects all the information about the project by first writing down all the points and thoughts. He usually uses a list to do this.</p>

In addition, they are very small-step - so it would be an immense amount of work to create everything individually. While other tool attempts failed here due to the high effort and slow processes, awork convinced the team: In awork, they can easily create task and project templates and reuse them for similar processes.</p></blockquote>

<p>For time-critical projects, team tietge switches from the list view to the awork timeline in order to dedicate themselves to the time planning of the project. They provide tasks with dependencies to make it transparent which tasks are the basis for other to-dos. They also use milestones as intermediate goals for their projects. By jumping into the timeline, team tietge can also define and flexibly adjust the chronological course of their project - including milestones, dependencies &amp; co.</p>

<p>To answer these questions, team tietge organizes itself with team planning in awork. Christian gets an overview of all capacities and distributes the to-dos to the appropriate employees.</p>

<p>In this way, team tietge can avoid possible overload of individual team members and thus reduce delays in projects and tasks. With the <a href=""https://www.awork.io/en/blog/out-now-the-new-planner%f0%9f%92%9c/"">awork planner</a>, Christian can easily add new to-dos to the calendars of his team members and has exactly on the screen who still has capacity.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to the Corona pandemic, many well-rehearsed processes that only worked in personal communication could no longer be implemented. When Christian switched to a home office, he and his team had to find out where everyone stood and who was responsible for which to-dos.&nbsp;</p>

<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>awork was a game changer for the team: Christian can also delegate tasks to his team remotely and give clear briefings with the help of task descriptions. The task comments are used by team tietge for feedback or to discuss the current status of tasks.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How does team tietge manage collaboration with external customers in awork? To collaborate with customers, gather ideas for tasks, and plan projects together, team tietge uses the guest licenses for external users in awork. Christian finds this particularly practical, as the licenses simplify joint planning on projects and collaboration.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If tasks are especially important or urgent, you can mark them with a prio flag. The prio flag for tasks was a bit hidden here and there. We have changed that. Now the flag is red-highlighted and super visible in the list and board view, as well as in the task details and edit window.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, you can now mark tasks as prio via the hover actions in the board or list view, which speeds up your workflow significantly.</p>

<p>In awork you can get notified for many things via emails - for example, when you get assigned a new task. Super handy for those who check their mailbox often anyway.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, our notification emails were missing relevant information here and there. We have added the missing information, such as the project name, the triggering person, the exact event time, a preview of comments, etc..</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We also made the subject line more appealing and replaced all the images. Nicenstein!</p>

<p>Many teams love our board view. It provides a nice overview of which tasks are in which status. However, a few small things were missing here to make it usable for power users as well. That's why we've made a lot of small improvements:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

Then the window now scrolls automatically when you drag a card to the left or right edge of the Kanban board.</li><li>What's not to miss: Longer task names in multiple rows are now displayed more clearly without the cards getting super long.</li></ul>

<div style=""height:40px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We've also made two super handy improvements to the subtasks within a task:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. you can now copy a list of topics, e.g. from your notes, into the subtasks input field and awork will automatically create a subtask for each entry or line. These texts can be lists, but also notes separated by a line break. This way you can easily transfer your notes - for example from customer meetings or team meetings - as subtasks for an awork task.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. inserted links in subtasks are now clickable, so that a new browser window with the URL opens immediately. Additionally, they are displayed shortened, so in the same form as inserted links in description fields.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Show sender in tasks from emails: If tasks are created from emails, awork now writes the sender in the first line of the description. This way it is also clear who the email comes from if it was sent by a non-awork user.&nbsp;</li><li>Private tasks in the search: Your private tasks now also appear in the search.</li><li>Tooltip for small time entries in ""My times"": For small time entries in the day view under ""My times"", a tooltip is now displayed showing all info about the time entry.</li><li>Improved display of the person responsible for the project: The person responsible for a project is now marked by a small icon in the project details, so you can see even faster who owns the project.</li><li>Wider popups for selecting projects and tasks: The dropdowns for selecting projects, tasks, and clients are now displayed wider, so you can see more of the name and find the appropriate entry faster.</li><li>New layout of user details: We have re-layouted the details of a user so that they now look clearer.</li><li>Lots of mini improvements, styling fixes and improved wording: we've tweaked small design bugs, incomprehensible text and minor barriers all over awork to make the whole experience more intuitive and enjoyable.</li></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Get ready: The new action button is born!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It combines the old quick actions button (now called ""actions""), the search and the green plus button for creating new objects into our most powerful button yet. The new action button generates positive vibes whenever clicked and can’t wait to be used.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The search function didn’t really change that much. You can still just use the shortcut <strong>“f”</strong> to open up the search and type away. When accessed like this, you will see your latest search results listed as usual.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clicking on the action button instead to open up the search, you will now find the four main actions to create new data (projects, tasks, times and clients) right below the input field. This also appears when you use the new shortcut for the action button: <strong>“cmd (ctrl) + k”</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All flows and windows to create new things have received a detailed update to make your daily use of awork even smoother: They now all consist of a clean main input field. Just below you find the “Add details” button, which allows you to add any possible detail to your new project, task, time or client right away – super simple.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, while still having all the options as usual, we reduced the visual overload by a lot. The standard prefill of specific, already known data, e.g. the project, the type of work or if a time is billable, stays the same. Only exception: When creating a new client in awork, there is no option to add contact details inside of the main input field. Instead, just use the details section of the new client after creating it with the action button.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s the best thing about the new input field: Every single detail can easily be added with slash (“/”) commands. Once you get the hang of it, you will be lightning fast when creating new objects in awork.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""align"":""center"",""id"":31502,""sizeSlug"":""large"",""linkDestination"":""custom""} -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How exactly does it work? /easy! For example, if you start typing <strong>“/luc”</strong> into the input field, awork will directly propose to add your colleague Lucy to a project or task, which can be done by just hitting <em>Enter </em>right away. Same applies for <strong>“/6h”</strong> to add 6 hours of planned effort, <strong>“/tomorrow”</strong> to set the deadline for the next day as well as many other shortcuts. Precise dates are no problem either, just type <strong>“/23.12.22”</strong> to be ready by christmas eve. To add a project or task description, use <strong>“//”</strong> and a new input area appears to receive all your useful information –&nbsp;nice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every single action has a corresponding shortcut which can be used anywhere and anytime in awork. Check this short overview to be perfectly prepared for some highspeed actions:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>cmd (ctrl) + k = Action menu &amp; search</strong></li><li><strong>f = Search</strong></li><li><strong>p = Project</strong></li><li><strong>t = Task</strong></li><li><strong>z = Time</strong></li></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Good news for all automation nerds out there: awork has a new option to use for projects and project templates. This one is all about importing and adding a task template into a project. This enables you to automatically, for example, add whole task lists into a project, as soon as it hits a particular status or a specific person gets assigned to it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Super helpful, when you want to add tasks to a project, that only make sense to a very certain moment – some usual suspects are tasks for billing, feedback or retro.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When dealing with large windows and lots of content, sometimes the buttons to close, select or save moved out of sight of the browser window and you had to scroll to reach them. We changed that, so from now on buttons get “sticky” when reaching the edge of the browser window and stay there for easy access. This way you have all possible options at all times, just a click away –&nbsp;smoooth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The popups, for example when choosing a date or user for an object, have also been improved and unified in appearance and functionality. Previously there were some slight differences or on other occasions, there was some trouble when clicking on the backdrop to close a popup window. These topics are all dealt with, to make using awork even more pleasant and intuitive for you and your team.</p>

<p>Interested in smart integrations that will make your daily work life just a little better? Perfect match! This month, we are happy to announce two new integrations: <strong>easybill</strong> and <strong>Make</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>easybill is a cloud based billing software from Germany that is suitable for companies of any size. Topics such as invoice generation, document management or pre-factoring can be implemented easily and automatically with easybill. This integration works just like our already existing billing tool integrations do –&nbsp;connect and enjoy the lean workflow. With only a few clicks you are able to transfer your tracked times directly from awork to a new or already existing easybill invoice. Just use the button “Invoice time”' in your time reports.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second integration is for Make (make.com) and enables awork to be used as a connector. Similar to Zapier, Make is a no-code platform to create workflow automations between different apps. With help of a visual builder, Make allows you to build complex and endless workflows in an intuitive way. To integrate awork in this, you have two main options. On the one hand, awork can be used as a trigger for specific automations. On the other hand, it is possible to trigger specific actions in awork if there is a trigger from another app.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, you can set it up to trigger some action when a set project status in awork is reached. Or you let another event trigger some action inside of awork, like creating a new project. Very handy.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having a better overview is always a good thing. That's why we introduced a new option for the project overview: the timeline view. This way you can not only view your tasks, but also all your projects in a timeline context and plan them even better. To do so, go to <em>Projects</em> in the main menu and set the switch at the top to <em>Timeline</em>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The quick filters for selecting the displayed projects (""All"", ""My active"", ""All active"" and ""All closed"") have moved to the dropdown menu next to the view selection. We have re-added the ""All"" field here due to your frequent requests. Selected filters remain active even when you change the view.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order to see a project in the timeline, it must have a start and end date, similar to what you already know from tasks. When a project is displayed in the timeline, you will automatically see its milestones – as long as you have the appropriate permission to see them.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Precise workload calculation with individual working hours? No big deal anymore. Instead of the total weekly working time, you can now set an individual working time per weekday for each user. To do so, either go to your own user profile as before and adjust your times, or click on the workload overview next to the user you would like to edit directly in the planner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This way you can set individual capacities for each day of the week, from 0 to 12 hours per day. If 0h is entered for a day, the user is generally not available on that day. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Changes to individual working times are immediately taken into account in the planner. This is illustrated by the gray, dashed line in the workload overview, which depicts the corresponding availabilities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the working time varies on different days of the week, the automatic distribution of planned hours, e.g. from projects or tasks, is also affected. The distribution is always done relatively to the available time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""><p><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">A quick example:</span> We have a task with 8h planned effort and 2 days duration. Paula has entered varying working hours for the next 2 days - 8h on the first day and 4h on the second day. We schedule the task with Paula and the planner automatically distributes the task to 5:20h on the first day and 2:40h on the second day. Thus, the same proportion of Paula's available daily working time is used for the task on both days.</em></p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not only daily working hours can now be defined more precisely. With the new <strong>half-day absences</strong>, you can also include half days of vacation or other absences more precisely in the planning. There are various options to set this up: By dragging and creating, by resizing existing absences or by selecting ""half-day only"" when creating or by editing an absence.</p>

<p>The awork planner and your own calendar are made for each other. That's why we have worked on our calendar integration and improved it extensively to bring your planning game to the next level. Especially the synchronization between the awork calendar and the individual Google or Microsoft calendars is important here. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Previously, if a task was scheduled in the planner's calendar view, awork created an additional calendar for it in your Google or Microsoft calendar. From now on, a target calendar can be selected directly in awork, such as the main calendar of your own Google or Microsoft account. This saves you one step in scheduling and allows you to get straight to the important things.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tasks that are transferred from awork to the calendar and displayed there as appointments are recognized as such during synchronization and are therefore not displayed twice in the awork planner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The desired target calendar can also be adjusted later in the settings of your calendar integration.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Appointments in your calendar where you are ""available""/""free"" instead of ""busy"" will be recognized and understood as such in awork. They are shown dashed in the awork calendars in the planner and under <em>My planner</em> and will not be considered in the workload calculation.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The biggest aid for perfect absence management so far? Our new <a href=""https://www.personio.com"">Personio</a> integration. With the help of this new integration, awork automatically retrieves information from the HR tool Personio about entered absences in order to map and take them into account directly when planning in awork. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To set up the integration, simply select ""Personio"" in the integration library and follow the setup instructions. In order to use the integration, you must have a Personio account and the corresponding access data, which has to be stored in awork.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:acf/caption {""id"":""block_633bfda469883"",""name"":""acf/caption"",""data"":{""block_style"":""image_right"",""_block_style"":""field_60f95b1275292"",""margin_top"":""mt-s"",""_margin_top"":""field_60f9580be9b20"",""margin_bottom"":""mb-s"",""_margin_bottom"":""field_60f9580be9b57"",""headline"":""Whether on vacation, sick or differently absent – the Personio integration helps you to always see the full picture."",""_headline"":""field_60f9580be9bca"",""text"":"""",""_text"":""field_60f958340140f"",""image"":31914,""_image"":""field_60f9584001410""},""align"":"""",""mode"":""preview""} /-->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""><p><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Important:</span> The matching of the users is done via the account email address, so it has to be identical for both accounts - awork and Personio.</em></p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once set up, awork synchronizes with Personio 1x per hour and updates all absences, whether new or adjusted. Personio absences are marked accordingly and cannot be edited or deleted in awork. If the entire Personio integration is removed, this will also delete all Personio absences from awork.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Besides the Personio absences, you can of course create, edit or remove other absences directly in awork as usual. However, these will not be transferred to Personio.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You love the planner as much as we do. Therefore, the continuous improvement of its usability is especially close to our hearts. In this release we were able to pick up and improve many more individual aspects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starting with small elements in the timeline, such as short tasks or projects. These can now be viewed in full by hovering over them with the mouse if the small width of the element does not allow this in the normal view. Smaller items now automatically widen on interaction, revealing their full name and other details. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:acf/caption {""id"":""block_633be667a5777"",""name"":""acf/caption"",""data"":{""block_style"":""image_right"",""_block_style"":""field_60f95b1275292"",""margin_top"":""mt-s"",""_margin_top"":""field_60f9580be9b20"",""margin_bottom"":""mb-s"",""_margin_bottom"":""field_60f9580be9b57"",""headline"":""Good usability = better joy at work.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Projects have their own small action button (3 dots) at the right end of the element in the <em>Workload</em> and <em>Timeline</em> planner views. This button can be used to quickly and easily make changes to the project or to directly access in-depth project planning in form of the specific project timeline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have also optimized the process of how users are assigned in the planner when tasks are dragged and dropped into the timeline or calendar. A new hint at the bottom of the screen now lets you choose whether only the target user on whose row the task is dropped should be assigned to the task, or whether all existing users on the task should remain assigned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tasks are often scheduled using the calendar view in the planner and are placed on the free slots in the weekly overview. In doing so, resizing the already allocated task was often too fuzzy to prepare the day perfectly. Now a more precise adjustment of the task duration is very easy. Tasks scheduled in the calendar can be reduced to a minimum duration of 5 minutes and enlarged or reduced in steps of 15 minutes by just using the mouse. Even further fine-tuning is possible via the scheduled task's own action button (3 dots) - here you can manually adjust the time in 5-minute steps and also, for example, the day on which the task is due.</p>

<h2 id=""2""><strong>Attention: One thing is going to disappear </strong>☝️</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The possibility to define planning efforts for users on project level will be removed with the upcoming update. This planning has proven to be impractical because the time period to plan users was always fixed to the project period. Additionally, these long bars took up a lot of space in the user overview of the timeline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead, we introduce ""<strong>bookings</strong>"" in the new planner. Now you can freely book (reserve) time for each user and each project, even without tasks - without having to create tasks for them. With the release of the new planner, the already set up efforts for projects are transferred to the new bookings. Of course, these can then be customized individually for all users.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The new bookings work slightly different than the project plan efforts. Therefore the workload calculation will change slightly. If you currently use the planned efforts on the project level, then the workload will be displayed increased with the release. In this case you will have to adjust it once in the new booking element. If you have not used the effort planning on project level, this change does not affect you. If you have any questions about this, you can always <a href=""mailto:support@awork.io"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">contact us in support.</a></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Providing <strong>the best capacity planning in the world</strong> - that is one of our goals at awork.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The awork planner has been live in beta since May. Already, it makes possible what other tools out there cannot: <strong>Combining project planning with the team's personal calendars.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So why are we upgrading the planner again? Since the planner launch we have received an incredible amount of feedback from you, conducted numerous usability tests and already added a few missing details.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While doing so, three points came up again and again:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The workload view is essential for checking workload and it worked great as a basis for the timeline to schedule tasks. However, due to the separate views, the workflows were sometimes incomprehensible.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Although the value of the individual views is immediately recognizable, the necessary jumping between the variants made use unnecessarily difficult. In particular, getting started with the planner was negatively influenced by this.&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Rough planning at the project level lacks detail, and planning at the task level is too time-consuming to schedule just a few users. The path to ab accurate workload calculation became too tedious as a result.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, all of that is history. With this update, we've put all the insights gathered together. </p>

<p>Sometimes less is more. In the new planner layout, you'll now find <strong>only two views</strong>: Calendar &amp; timeline. The workload view is integrated directly into the timeline. This makes your team planning even clearer. In the timeline you can see your planned projects. With a click on a project you can directly open its timeline. So you can easily go through your project tasks and know what's coming up next. This view is also ideal to make a concrete planning within your project. In the <strong>project timeline you can create new projects for the selected time range via drag-and-drop.</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Super practical: In the planner timeline, you can now see the workload of the users in the lower area. In this way, you always have an overview of the workload of your team in parallel to the project or task planning and make sure that no one is overbooked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By <strong>maximizing the workload view</strong>, you can easily distribute tasks using the new task sidebar (which is now always visible).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hide the workload charts to get the maximum overview of who is working on what. Simply drag and drop new tasks, absences, and, now, bookings at the bottom of the workload timeline. From now on, you can also reserve the capacity of your team members - more on that in a moment. The calendar view is still as you know it and largely unchanged. However, the calendar now also features the new task sidebar. This way you can quickly schedule your tasks. 😎</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The new task sidebar gives you <strong>faster access to exactly the tasks you need </strong>to plan. It's never been easier to assign tasks from different projects to the right team members. Now all you have to do is get started.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We've already done some preliminary work to<strong> make it as easy as possible for you</strong> to use. In the sidebar, simply choose between your existing task filters, projects or the three predefined filters: My, New, Private. Under ""New"" you will find all tasks that you have created or been assigned to in the last seven days.</p>

<p>Is your project still too imprecise or the timeline planning for your projects too time-consuming (e.g. due to many small mini-tasks)? Then make your life easier with the new postings for resource and workload planning. It's fast, transparent and enables a whole new and easy way of team planning in awork.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With this release, we've <strong>removed reserving time for users at the project level and introduced ""bookings"" in the planner instead</strong>. Bookings can be used to block capacities, e.g. to reserve certain team members for upcoming projects in rough planning. As soon as the project is planned in more detail, the bookings can be easily transferred to tasks.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bookings can be created and edited via drag-create in the timeline in the planner or directly in the project, just like you already know it from tasks. A booking always belongs to a specific project, as well as user and has a planned effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:acf/caption {""id"":""block_638096ff38cab"",""name"":""acf/caption"",""data"":{""block_style"":""image_left"",""_block_style"":""field_60f95b1275292"",""margin_top"":""mt-s"",""_margin_top"":""field_60f9580be9b20"",""margin_bottom"":""mb-s"",""_margin_bottom"":""field_60f9580be9b57"",""headline"":""Quickly reserve time for the next project.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The user is booked (reserved) for this project in the period, which is of course also reflected in the workload. At this point, tasks no longer have to serve as annoying placeholders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can assign as many of these bookings per project to users as you like. <strong>This makes the rough planning much more flexible</strong> than the previous project reservations. By the way: Bookings do not appear in task lists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""20px""} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do you sometimes lose track of all the projects in your timeline? We know the problem. That's why you can now assign a color to projects via the action menu or the task sidebar. Corresponding projects, tasks and bookings will then also appear in the timeline in the appropriate color. <strong>This way you can see better and faster what belongs to which project.</strong> For example, select web design projects in blue and print projects in yellow - so you can see at a glance how much is pending in which area.</p>

<p>Working in the planner has become so much smoother and better with this update. But one final step is still missing: It should be as easy as possible for you to switch from rough to detailed planning. To link them perfectly, we have created <strong>a new task timeline within projects</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It has the same functions as before, but is peppered with some practical improvements:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The timeline design has been optimized</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The start of each project is now also visually marked</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Tasks scheduled in the timeline now pop up on hover to see the full name</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>You can directly assign a planned effort to your tasks here</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Timeline export is now also available as vector graphic in svg format</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Individually, these changes are small things, but together they vastly improve your use of the task timeline. You'll quickly see what we mean. 😉</p>

<p>But that was not all. We also have a little surprise for you besides the planner upgrade.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In parallel, we have developed an add-on (plugin) for Google Sheets, which you can add from the add-on catalog (at Google Sheets).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:acf/caption {""id"":""block_6380974338cac"",""name"":""acf/caption"",""data"":{""block_style"":""image_right"",""_block_style"":""field_60f95b1275292"",""margin_top"":""mt-s"",""_margin_top"":""field_60f9580be9b20"",""margin_bottom"":""mb-s"",""_margin_bottom"":""field_60f9580be9b57"",""headline"":""Now it's easy to add your data from awork to Google Sheets dashboards."",""_headline"":""field_60f9580be9bca"",""text"":"""",""_text"":""field_60f958340140f"",""image"":33064,""_image"":""field_60f9584001410""},""align"":"""",""mode"":""preview""} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the awork plugin you can load <strong>data like projects, tasks, users &amp; times directly into your Google Sheet</strong> and use it for evaluations and dashboards. How cool is that? This way your dashboard for the project meeting is ready in seconds. Also the monthly time evaluation for customers is much faster. But these are just two of many more use cases. Try it out for yourself!&nbsp;</p>

33237,"5 planning flows for your capacity planning","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The planner is one of our favorite awork features and <strong>unique on the market in this form.</strong> Until now, no tool has managed to bring project and resource planning in the team really clearly down to the individual calendar date.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The challenges are also anything but trivial. Bringing together short-term and long-term planning with a high level of detail in one tool, in order to finally be able to realistically assess when and where capacities are still available. Sounds complicated, but it is.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>With countless use cases, the planner brings a lot of potential.</strong> However, every team has its very own planning mode. That's why we'll show you five flows for your daily work with the planner - regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. This way you can see what suits your team and maybe it will inspire you to try out something new.</p>

<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You have already roughly planned a project a few months ago and blocked time for it. Now the start of the project is getting closer and it's time for the detailed planning of the process. Which tasks should happen when over the next few weeks? What are important milestones or intermediate goals in the project? What are the dependencies between the to-dos? The timeline is perfect for this detailed project planning.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How it works:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, the timeline is also an effective tool for concrete project planning. The to-dos can be directly scheduled in the team and milestones can be entered. The clear workload display makes it immediately clear who in the team has capacities and when.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Open the project in the timeline view and the task bar on the left.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's time to enter dependencies between tasks and milestones. Now just add employees with free capacities. This is how easy accurate project planning works in awork.</p>

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Weekly capacity planning is essential for every team.</strong> The team meeting is often used to discuss the current projects and to get an overview. The planner with its new layout is exactly the right place for this.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For this we start in the timeline view. Maximize the workload view in the planner and open the sidebar on the left.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""20px""} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""20px""} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Select a project or filter of tasks you want to schedule. Now grab the tasks and assign them to members of your team. If capacity is not an issue, this step can be done without the visible workload charts. In that case you will only see who is working on what. In the timeline, you can adjust all the set elements and add more tasks and absences.&nbsp;</p>

<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyday planning often turns out to be chaotic. Meetings, already planned tasks and then spontaneous requests come up regularly. What helps? The perfect overview to keep everything in view. In the planner, this is exactly what is possible: In the calendar view, the appointments can be seen, tasks can be used as additional blockers and it is directly visible where there is still room for spontaneous requests. Even better: <strong>The team can simply take over the planning here themselves, after all, it's their calendar too.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In many use cases, project managers create the tasks and add appropriate tags. These can then be retrieved by the team. To do this, you first need to open the calendar view of the planner. There you select your team to load the calendar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""20px""} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Opening the sidebar now allows you to select project or task filters. Here, the tags help each person on the team find just the right tasks. Finally, they then look at their calendar in the planner itself and organize their own day or week.</p>

<p>Knowledge work has never changed as quickly as it does today. The macroeconomic climate is in flux, but one thing is certain: <strong>we will work differently in the coming years than we do today.</strong> More distributed, more collaborative, and with further blurring of boundaries between private and professional organization.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That's a good thing, too, because still much of how we work is based on the last millennium’s best-practice - but the world has moved on. We need more innovative teams and work environments that bring joy to their teams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>That's exactly what awork stands for.</strong> As a tool for better, more modern teamwork and as an inspiration for how collaborative work can succeed over the next few years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When we founded awork in 2019, we started with the firm belief that more and more teams will recognize this shift towards new work and seek methods and tools that not only enable it, but drive it. Today, over 2,200 companies with more than 17,000 active users are working better together thanks to awork, and we're ready to take the next step.</p>

<p>Since this year, we also have a new office in the heart of Hamburg, because hybrid working also includes <strong>a shared home</strong>. Our headquarters is a place to put our heads together, focus and celebrate together. We’ll create a small production studio for training and <a href=""https://www.awork.io/en/webinars/"">webinars</a> with our clients and we have space for big all hands rounds and workshops as a team. <strong>It's the place where our team culture can take a very tangible form.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For all these developments in the team, our <a href=""https://www.awork.io/en/about-us/"">9 values</a> remain our guardrails. For a team of our age and size, it sometimes sounds a bit trite to talk about a ""values-based team culture"". But even a few years after we developed them together, they still accurately describe the things we value, and that does make us proud. We want to be an example and<strong> inspiration for other teams</strong> who also want to find more happiness in their work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This year, we will grow to over 40 aworkies and continue to do everything we can to preserve our special team culture - also and especially because we continue to work as a hybrid team. Team members from Rome to Rio belong to awork and that's exactly how it should continue: <a href=""https://www.awork.io/en/open-positions/"">As of now, we are looking for new teammates in many different roles!</a></p>

<p>The larger funding round is good news for our product. Thanks to the growing product and engineering team, we will be able to <strong>further improve the quality of the application in all areas </strong>and also implement one or two truly revolutionary enhancements. This will lead to our product roadmap over the coming months:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Already in progress are some long-awaited enhancements to our project and task management basics that will keep us busy in Q1. For example, we are implementing the option to manage more complex subtasks, enabling many new use cases for awork users. As always, we're investing a lot of time and resources into making this implementation simple and clear, so that more options don't lead to more confusion. This is exactly why another evolutionary step of our interface is coming up in the first months of 2023. <strong>We're taking a close look at everything to eliminate inconsistencies</strong>, shorten click paths, and make awork simpler and clearer overall (and prettier, too 😉).</p>

<p>Another area that is used more frequently than average and whose every simplification affects thousands of users a day is our integrated time tracking. We will expand the possible reports and improve the handling of budgets and their achievement - thinking about desktop versions and other easier ways of time tracking is also on our agenda.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Besides improving the most used awork features, we have a few even bigger plans. <strong>We are certain that collaborative and more flexible work across organizational boundaries will become increasingly important and frequent in the coming years.</strong> The growth of the freelancer and creator economies, more frequently changing service partners and their networks are just a few examples of the underlying trends. The question, then, is what systems and tools (like awork) need to look like to make the organization of collaborative work as frictionless as possible. This is precisely the topic we will be addressing in the second half of the year - so that collaborating with customers, partners, freelancers and service providers becomes as easy as maintaining your own todo list.</p>

<p>The larger funding round is good news for our product. Thanks to the growing product and engineering team, we will be able to <strong>further improve the quality of the application in all areas </strong>and also implement one or two truly revolutionary enhancements. This will lead to our product roadmap over the coming months:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Already in progress are some long-awaited enhancements to our project and task management basics that will keep us busy in Q1. For example, we are implementing the option to manage more complex subtasks, enabling many new use cases for awork users. As always, we're investing a lot of time and resources into making this implementation simple and clear, so that more options don't lead to more confusion. This is exactly why another evolutionary step of our interface is coming up in the first months of 2023. <strong>We're taking a close look at everything to eliminate inconsistencies</strong>, shorten click paths, and make awork simpler and clearer overall (and prettier, too 😉).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another area that is used more frequently than average and whose every simplification affects thousands of users a day is our integrated time tracking. We will expand the possible reports and improve the handling of budgets and their achievement - thinking about desktop versions and other easier ways of time tracking is also on our agenda.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Besides improving the most used awork features, we have a few even bigger plans. <strong>We are certain that collaborative and more flexible work across organizational boundaries will become increasingly important and frequent in the coming years.</strong> The growth of the freelancer and creator economies, more frequently changing service partners and their networks are just a few examples of the underlying trends. The question, then, is what systems and tools (like awork) need to look like to make the organization of collaborative work as frictionless as possible. This is precisely the topic we will be addressing in the second half of the year - so that collaborating with customers, partners, freelancers and service providers becomes as easy as maintaining your own todo list.</p>

<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

We see this as another essential building block for the coming period.</p>

<p>Already in progress are some long-awaited enhancements to our project and task management basics that will keep us busy in Q1. For example, we are implementing the option to manage more complex subtasks, enabling many new use cases for awork users. As always, we're investing a lot of time and resources into making this implementation simple and clear, so that more options don't lead to more confusion. This is exactly why another evolutionary step of our interface is coming up in the first months of 2023. <strong>We're taking a close look at everything to eliminate inconsistencies</strong>, shorten click paths, and make awork simpler and clearer overall (and prettier, too 😉).</p>

<p>Another area that is used more frequently than average and whose every simplification affects thousands of users a day is our integrated time tracking. We will expand the possible reports and improve the handling of budgets and their achievement - thinking about desktop versions and other easier ways of time tracking is also on our agenda.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Besides improving the most used awork features, we have a few even bigger plans. <strong>We are certain that collaborative and more flexible work across organizational boundaries will become increasingly important and frequent in the coming years.</strong> The growth of the freelancer and creator economies, more frequently changing service partners and their networks are just a few examples of the underlying trends. The question, then, is what systems and tools (like awork) need to look like to make the organization of collaborative work as frictionless as possible. This is precisely the topic we will be addressing in the second half of the year - so that collaborating with customers, partners, freelancers and service providers becomes as easy as maintaining your own todo list.</p>

<p>In addition to major extensions, several thousand improvements and optimizations have accumulated in our product roadmap over the last few months. Maturing awork as a product is not just about the milestones and big feature launches, but about continuously improving all processes and their user experience. We see this as another essential building block for the coming period.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your project is full of lists and tasks, and it keeps getting bigger? You're looking for a way to work even more clearly and structured? Say no more: Here come the new subtasks in awork!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In awork, <strong>tasks can now be structured hierarchically</strong> by nesting them with each other one level down. This allows you to have more overview and order in your project and also provides new possibilities in fine planning and assigning tasks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But let's start at the beginning. The previous subtasks in a task were more of a simple checklist for ticking off, so we renamed them <strong>""checklist""</strong> – apart from that, everything remains the same for now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What's new is exactly what a <strong>subtask</strong> is. In addition to the checklist, you can now add subtasks to a task that work just like full-fledged tasks. This means that they also include all the functions of a usual task – from the assignment and comment function to the scheduling in the timeline to the specific time tracking. Yay!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>This is how you create subtasks:<br></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Drag &amp; drop in the list view</strong><br>Simply drag your desired task onto another existing task to nest it. Drag it out of the list of a parent task to separate the two tasks again.<br><br></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Add details to a task</strong><br>When creating a task, you can assign it to another task by clicking on ""Parent task"" via the ""Add details"" option. Here is one for those of you with quick fingers: there is also the option to enter the corresponding title of the desired parent task via a slash command in the quick actions and nest the new task accordingly.<br><br></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>With a mouse click or tab on keyboard in the list view</strong><br>If you create a new task in a list below an existing one, a new icon appears. With a mouse click or with the tab key on your keyboard, you can nest the new task to the existing task above.<br><br></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong><strong>Within the details of a task</strong></strong><br>In the details of a task, you will find the list of the corresponding subtasks (below the checklist). Here you can also create new subtasks directly and manage them.<br><br></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Converting checklists</strong><br>You can easily convert your existing checklists into the new comprehensive subtasks. Simply click on the three dots next to the checklist and select the corresponding action. Voilà, your points from the checklist have now become full-fledged subtasks!&nbsp;<br><br></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>This is how the new task structure looks in the different views:<br></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>List view</strong><br>In the task lists of a project, the expandable hierarchy of individual tasks is now displayed. Parent tasks can be expanded and contracted by clicking on the icon left to the status.<br><br></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Board</strong><br>In the board view, you initially only see parent tasks as cards. These can be expanded to display the subtasks with their respective information.<br><br></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Timeline</strong><br>In the task sidebar, subtasks are displayed in the same nested view as in the task list. In the timeline, subtasks can be planned in the same way as any other task and you can also assign dependencies to them.<br><br></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both parent tasks and subtasks <strong>will</strong> <strong>be displayed when using task filters</strong>. As usual, only tasks that match the filter criteria will be shown. So, if you're assigned to a subtask and not to a parent task, that subtask will be displayed to you as a top level task without the corresponding parent task. On the dashboard under ""My tasks"", all assigned subtasks will also be displayed as top level tasks as long as you're only assigned to them. If you're also assigned to the corresponding parent task, you'll see the nested structure of the task and will be able to expand or contract it as you prefer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When a task has subtasks, a <strong>new metric will be displayed in the details of the parent task</strong>, showing you the total time tracked, including all subtasks, as well as the initially planned value.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since each subtask has all the features of a regular task, you can <strong>group and summarize time reports by parent or subtasks</strong>. This allows you to decide which hierarchy level you want to consider for your report.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, there are a few minor limitations when working with subtasks – but don't worry, they will be addressed shortly. The following areas will be delivered soon:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Maintaining task hierarchy in templates</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Recurring tasks with included subtasks</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Automations to create subtasks</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Automations to reflect status changes on parent tasks</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Bulk selecting and editing multiple tasks simultaneously (e.g. to nest them with another task)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""60px""} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""2""><strong><strong><strong>Individual planned effort for users of the same task</strong></strong></strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""20px""} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For all you detail-oriented planning pandas out there, here's a special highlight:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Previously, if <strong>multiple users were assigned to the same task</strong>, the planned effort for the task was always evenly distributed among them. However, in practice, one person is usually responsible for a larger part of the task, while others may only take on smaller portions. The even distribution of effort then led to inaccuracies, particularly in workload calculations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That's why it's now possible to set<strong> individual planned efforts for multiple users of a single task</strong>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:acf/caption {""name"":""acf/caption"",""data"":{""block_style"":""image_left"",""_block_style"":""field_60f95b1275292"",""margin_top"":""mt-s"",""_margin_top"":""field_60f9580be9b20"",""margin_bottom"":""mb-s"",""_margin_bottom"":""field_60f9580be9b57"",""headline"":""Full transparency when splitting the effort of a task"",""_headline"":""field_60f9580be9bca"",""text"":"""",""_text"":""field_60f958340140f"",""image"":35572,""_image"":""field_60f9584001410""},""mode"":""preview""} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In general, the planned effort for a task is still<strong> evenly distributed among all users, unless individual values are specified</strong>. If an individual effort is defined for one or more users, the remaining effort is then distributed evenly among the remaining team members.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""60px""} -->
<div style=""height:60px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""3""><strong><strong><strong>Recurring tasks in timeline and workload</strong></strong></strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:spacer {""height"":""20px""} -->
<div style=""height:20px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Recurring tasks help you to easily control repetitive to-dos without forgetting them. To keep your task lists tidy and neat, only the currently due tasks are displayed in awork, not their future repetitions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the timeline, this is a bit different: Here it's very helpful to see future recurring tasks early on. That's why an <strong>automatic preview of the future repetitions of a task</strong> is now displayed, so you won't lose sight of anything when looking ahead into the future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Previewed tasks can't be edited directly in the timeline and are only displayed for the next 8 months for technical reasons. Once a preview task starts, it is transformed directly into the new main task.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:acf/caption {""name"":""acf/caption"",""data"":{""block_style"":""image_right"",""_block_style"":""field_60f95b1275292"",""margin_top"":""mt-s"",""_margin_top"":""field_60f9580be9b20"",""margin_bottom"":""mb-s"",""_margin_bottom"":""field_60f9580be9b57"",""headline"":""Recurring tasks in the preview to never have them out of sight"",""_headline"":""field_60f9580be9bca"",""text"":"""",""_text"":""field_60f958340140f"",""image"":35574,""_image"":""field_60f9584001410""},""mode"":""preview""} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another enjoyable moment for the planning pandas among you: <strong>recurring tasks are now also included in workload calculations</strong>, provided the main task has assigned team members and an appropriate planned effort. 💪</p>
